      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p> During the first third of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, different conferences held on child protection  (<a href="#" id="bib10">Dávila &amp; Naya, 2006</a>) laid the groundwork for subsequent international policies, which culminated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child,
         in which children became the subject of rights for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>After having been laboriously drafted for one decade, the Convention was approved by the General Assembly in Resolution 44/25
         dated 20 November 1989, and the signing and ratification or adhesion to the Convention was held in New York on 26 January
         1990. The Convention entered into force on 2 September 1990 in conformance with the provisions contained in its article 49.
      </p>
      <p>On 1 October 2015, Somalia ratified the Convention, and since then a total of 196 countries have adhered to this important
         multilateral commitment to protect the fundamental guarantees of childhood. Therefore, this is the human rights treaty that
         has been the most widely ratified in history. The United States is the only country that has yet to complete the process.
         Despite having signed it in 1995, it has not yet ratified the Convention; that is, it supports the rights described in the
         document but is not legally committed to abide by it.
      </p>
      <p>In order for the rights of children to be meaningful, it is not enough for a state to accept –or even ratify– the Convention
         on the rights of the Child. They must also put it into practice.
      </p>
      <p>With the intention of keeping watch over the exercise of the rights of the child, in 1991 the Committee on the Rights of the
         Child (CRC) was established, a body made up of independent experts who oversee implementation of the Convention on the Rights
         of the Child by the States Parties.
      </p>
      <p>As stated in its regulations, the Committee is headquartered in Geneva. It usually holds three periods of sessions per year.
         The sessions are comprised of a three-week plenary session. Previous to the period of sessions, a working group meets for
         one week.
      </p>
      <p>Article 4 of the Convention stipulates that states must effectively implement the rights of the child by adopting any measures
         needed, using up to the maximum resources available to do so. Article 44 requires the States Parties to report to the Committee
         on the measures they are taking to make the rights of the child a reality. 
      </p>
      <p>Thus, all the States Parties have to submit periodic reports to the Committee on the way these rights are exercised. Initially,
         the states have to submit a two-year report after adhering to the Convention, and later they must submit reports every five
         years. The Committee examines each report and expresses its concerns and recommendations to the States Parties in the guise
         of Final Observations.
      </p>
      <p>The reports must mention the measures that the States Parties have adopted to implement the rights listed in the Convention
         and the progress made in terms of enjoyment of these rights. They should also indicate any circumstances and difficulties,
         if applicable, that affect the degree of compliance with the main obligations of the Convention. Therefore, the reports must
         contain enough information for the Committee to gain an overall understanding of the implementation of the Convention in that
         country.
      </p>
      <p>The first periodic reports started in 1992. By the 71<sup>st</sup> session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child held on 29 January 2016, the Committee had received 493 reports in conformance
         with article 44 of the convention, including 198 initial reports and 295 periodic reports.
      </p>
      <h2>Case Study: The Child’s Right to Play</h2>
      <p>The Article 31 of the Convention explicitly states that “States Parties recognize the right of the child to rest and leisure,
         to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life
         and the arts”  (<a href="#" id="bib6">Brooker &amp; Woodhead, 2013</a>; <a href="#" id="bib21">Lester &amp; Russell, 2008</a>).
      </p>
      <p>We expressly wish to address this right by focusing attention exclusively on the child’s right to play. As stated in UNICEF’s
         Handbook for the Implementation of the CRC (<a href="#" id="bib17">Hodgkin &amp; Newell</a>, p. 469) "play" is arguably the most interesting in terms of childhood, in that it includes children’s activities which are
         not controlled by adults and which do not necessarily conform to any rules. The concept of free play is tricky. Play is either
         free or it is not. In cities, where more and more children on the planet live and will continue to live, freedom and creativity
         of play cannot be conditioned or –even worse– curtailed for the sake of safety and the increasing tendency for parents to
         be overprotective  (<a href="#" id="bib2">Bantulà &amp; Payà, 2020</a>; <a href="#" id="bib7">Canning, 2007</a>; <a href="#" id="bib22">Little, Wyver, &amp; Gibson, 2011</a>; <a href="#" id="bib32">Sandseter, 2007</a>).
      </p>
      <p>We are not going to dwell on the importance and benefits of play  (<a href="#" id="bib11">Engel, 2015</a>; <a href="#" id="bib15">Gleave &amp; Cole-Hamilton, 2012</a>; <a href="#" id="bib23">Manwaring &amp; Taylor, 2007</a>; <a href="#" id="bib36">Whitebread, 2012</a>). It is well known that play is essential to the development, health and wellbeing of children  (<a href="#" id="bib14">Ginsburg, 2007</a>; <a href="#" id="bib16">Goldstein, 2012</a>; <a href="#" id="bib19">Kernan, 2007</a>; <a href="#" id="bib25">Milteer, Ginsburg, &amp; Mulligan, 2012</a>; <a href="#" id="bib27">Navidi, 2016</a>; <a href="#" id="bib30">Pramling &amp; Asplund, 2008</a>; <a href="#" id="bib31">Sandberg &amp; Heden, 2011</a>; <a href="#" id="bib33">Tonkin, 2014</a>; <a href="#" id="bib37">White, 2012</a>). As Moyles bemoaned (<a href="#" id="bib26">2010</a>, p. 3), "the fact that we are still having to justify play’s existence in children’s cognitive, physical and social development
         seems incredible and appears to reflect an intransigence –even ignorance– on the part of policy makers and those who regulate
         the policies".
      </p>
      <p>Play cannot be considered a luxury (Fronczek, <a href="#" id="bib13">2009</a>, p. 28) or a right which must be honoured once other rights of the child have been achieved. Quite to the contrary, play
         is an essential, integral component  (<a href="#" id="bib20">Lester &amp; Russell, 2010</a>) which reinforces the four principles of the CRC: non-discrimination, survival and development, ensuring the child’s interests
         and participation  (<a href="#" id="bib24">Meire, 2007</a>).
      </p>
      <p>We concur with the International Play Association (IPA, <a href="#" id="bib18">2010</a>, p. 3) when its report recognises that the child’s right to play “is one of the least known, least understood and least recognised
         rights of childhood, and consequently it is one of the rights that is the most consistently ignored, undervalued and violated
         in today’s world”.
      </p>
      <p>For this reason, in 2008 the IPA forged an alliance with seven international organisations in order to propose that the United
         Nations’ <a href="#" id="bib8">Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) (2013)</a> hold a discussion day and draft a General Observation on Article 31 in order to explain its significance and expand the responsibilities
         of the States Parties to the Convention in terms of compliance with this article.
      </p>
      <p>With the intention of gathering information from all over the world, the IPA and its allies organised a World Consultation
         on Children’s Right to Play. Between January and July 2010, consultations were held in Bangkok, Beirut, Johannesburg, Mexico
         City, Bombay, Nairobi, Sofia and Tokyo. Three hundred and fifty experts in child play participated in the consultation, along
         with more than 400 children. As stated in the report (IPA,<a href="#" id="bib18">2010</a>), a total of 115 infractions were identified to prove noncompliance with the child’s right to play. At the same time, practical
         recommendations were developed for governments with regard to compliance with Article 31.
      </p>
      <p>The work done by the IPA paid off, and in the 62<sup>nd</sup> period of sessions held from 14 January to 1 February 2013, the Committee approved <i>General Observation 17 (2013) on the right of the child</i><i>to rest, leisure, play, recreational activities, cultural life and the arts (article 31)</i> in CRC/C/GC/17.
      </p>
      <p>In its introduction, the Committee expresses its concern with the States’ lack of recognition of the rights contained in Article
         31. It adds that "poor recognition of their significance in the lives of children results in lack of investment in appropriate
         provisions, weak or non-existent protective legislation and the invisibility of children in national and local-level planning.
         In general, where investment is made, it is in the provision of structured and orga-nized activities, but equally important
         is the need to create time and space for children to engage in spontaneous play, recrea-tion and creativity, and to promote
         societal attitudes that sup-port and encourage such activity."
      </p>
      <p>The committee expressed its concern with inequality in the enjoyment of the rights cited in Article 31 by girls, poor children,
         children with disabilities, indigenous children and those belonging to minorities, among others.
      </p>
      <p>Whether from rich or poor countries, children witness how child labour, household chores and the increasing demands of education
         are lowing the amount of time available to enjoy these rights.
      </p>
      <p>Now that the questions concerning the States Parties in relation to the right of the child to play have been presented, this
         study continues by formulating several questions with the intention of ascertaining the degree of compliance with this right.
      </p>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Is it possible to ascertain the degree to which article 31 of the Convention is applied from an international comparative
         per-spective?
      </p>
      <p>Likewise, if the international community, via the Committee on the Rights of the Child, believed that it was necessary to
         give this right greater emphasis, we should ask whether the approval of GO No. 17 in 2013 has signalled a change in states’
         child policies. In other words, do the States Parties invest more dedication and effort into fostering and defending the child’s
         right to play? It is essential to ascertain the impact on recognition of the child’s right to play since GO No. 17 has entered
         into force. How is this right being exercised? Are there reports on the indicators proposed by the Committee? What measures
         are the States Parties taking to foster child’s play in the family, school and social life?
      </p>
      <h1>METHODS</h1>
      <p>In order to answer these questions, we first reviewed the reports that the States Parties forwarded to the Committee on the
         Rights of the Child (CRC), as well as the Final Observations issued by this Committee to the States Parties, in which it tells
         them its opinion on the supposed advances and achievements cited by the states in their reports.
      </p>
      <p>The second phase of the study analyses whether the reports as well as the Final Observations issued since the date on which
         GO No. 17 was approved contain more references to article 31.
      </p>
      <p>As is common practice in other comparative studies (UNICEF, <a href="#" id="bib35">2004</a>), and given the physical impossibility of examining all the reports and general observations of the 196 states that have
         ratified the Convention, in the first part of the study we chose a sample comprised of 41 countries. These countries belong
         to the European Union, or to the OECD if they do not belong to the EU. In this way, the reports issued by the States Parties
         to the CRC were reviewed, while the CRC’s Final Observations to these same States Parties were also reviewed. The USA was
         excluded from the sample because, since it is an OECD member but has not ratified the Convention, it is not obligated to draw
         up reports or receive guidance from the CRC.
      </p>
      <p>In the second part, the sample was comprised of all the countries that have issued a report to the CRC after GO No. 17 entered
         into force (April 2013) and up to 31 December 2017. The review includes 78 States Parties. The CRC’s Final Observations for
         the States Parties on the periodic reports they submitted were also reviewed. The revision includes a total of 96 States Parties.
      </p>
      <p>By reading the reports and Final Observations of the States Parties in the study sample, all the information related to the
         child’s right to play was collected. To analyse the content of the document sources from a comparative, international perspective,
         three areas in which child’s play occurs were established: family, school and social. At the same time, for each area, four
         attributes that define the child’s right to play were established: play time, play space, play materials and playmates or
         players. 
      </p>
      <p>We intended to process the document information according to whether the state reported on the structural measures (legal,
         institutional and regulatory framework) or process (implementation of policies and action programmes) or whether it reported
         on the results obtained (achievements, level of implementation, exercise or violation of the right in practice). However,
         in many cases –as we shall see below– the States Parties do not clearly and precisely define the intentions and scope of their
         policies, thus hindering an evaluation of the recognition of this right  (<a href="#" id="bib3">Bantulà &amp; Payà, 2020</a>).
      </p>
      <h1>RESULTS</h1>
      <p> The results are outlined distinguishing between the two time-phases in which the information was analysed.</p>
      <h2>First Period of the Study: Reports and Final Observations Between 1992 and 2013</h2>
      <p>From 1992 until the approval of General Observation No. 17, the 40 States Parties belonging to the EU and/or the OECD, sent
         a total of 111 reports to the CRC: 40 first reports, 37 second reports, 30 third reports and 4 fourth reports. Of all of these
         reports, 66.66% make no mention of the child’s right to play. 
      </p>
      <p>During this same period (1992-2103), the 40 States Parties sent a total of 110 Final Observations to the CRC: 40 first observations,
         37 second observations, 29 third observations and 4 fourth observations. The CRC made no reference to the child’s right to
         play in 90% of the Final Observations. 
      </p>
      <p>We then proceeded to analyse the contents of the reports and the Final Observations in which references to the right being
         studied did appear.
      </p>
      <p>First, based on the document analysis of the 33.33% of the reports which included references to the child’s right to play,
         we should highlight the following issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>With just a handful of exceptions, the reports do not mention measures or actions in favour of play at home or in the family:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>The report from Austria (1997) mentions the celebration of a children’s festival which lasts all summer in Vienna, so that
                     parents and children can play as a family in any of the 47 city parks. Likewise, another report from Austria (2004) mentions
                     the publication of a brochure that uses multiple activities to promote family life and contact with nature in towns, nursery
                     schools and schools.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>In the area of education, several States Parties describe different initiatives:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>The reports from Germany (2003), Canada (2003 and 2012) and Iceland (2002) associate play with the child’s development, and
                     children are encouraged to play the in school curricula. Likewise, in Sweden (1997), the learning objectives stress the importance
                     of play and regard inspiring the children with plenty of time, spaces and materials for their games as an essential job. The
                     report from Sweden (2004) states that preschools have to offer a safe environment, furthermore one also stimulates children
                     to play and be active. It is essential to guarantee the child’s right to put his or her own initiative, imagination and creativity
                     into practice in an atmosphere of play and learning. Along the same lines, in the United Kingdom (2008), the Department of
                     Education implements a programme for children aged 2 which focuses on constructive play in groups in order to develop the
                     child’s social development, improve their communication and language skills and stimulate their imagination through play.
                     Furthermore, the educational system in Northern Ireland recognises that education is more effective when children learn through
                     an enriched experience based on play.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Ireland (1995) indicates that the local administrations have taken charge of building good playing fields in nursery schools.
                     The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (2003) reports on the creation of special play and recreation rooms in more than
                     150 nursery schools and day care centres. The report from the Netherlands (2008) states that some schools have improved and
                     adapted their buildings and sports and recreational facilities to ensure that they can be accessed and used by disabled students.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (2008) explains how many schools organise traditional games. The children are encouraged
                     to fly Korean kites, entertain themselves with swings and seesaws, jump rope and engage in other popular games.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>In terms of the social area, the reports contain a large number and wide range of different initiatives:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>There are countries whose governments recognise the importance of play. The United Kingdom (1999) states that high-quality
                     facilities benefit the child’s overall development. In its 2002 report, it mentions that the National Playing Fields Association
                     (NPFA) is in charge of the dissemination, education, training and safety of play. The NPFA has four training headquarters
                     for monitoring: it manages the National Play Information Centre (NPIC), which is the most important centre in the world specialising
                     in child’s play; it has a forum, the Play Safety Forum, whose publication “Playground Safety Guidelines” seeks a balance between
                     risk and safety in play. In Sweden (2004), the report states that children can lose creativity and spontaneity if the forms
                     of entertainment they are offered are organised in advance and are overly supervised and predefined. The report from Ireland
                     (2005) mentions that it is the first country in the world to have a detailed national policy on play (Ready, Steady, Play:
                     A National Play Policy). Spain (2009) indicates that one of the objectives of the Strategic National Childhood Plan is to
                     foster the child’s right to play, leisure and free time by creating appropriate, accessible and safe spaces.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>With regard to play in public space, there are several state initiatives which have enacted laws and measures taken to guarantee
                     sites meant for children and youths. Thus, in Austria (1997 and 2004), the United Kingdom (1999), Spain (2001), Italy (2002),
                     Germany (2003), Australia (2004), the Netherlands (2018) and Korea (2008), the urban planning regulations include the creation
                     of lands set aside for play and recreation. At the same time, in some cases they also encourage children’s participation in
                     the planning of these spaces. Guaranteeing the safety of playgrounds in Spain (2001), United Kingdom (2002), Canada (2003)
                     and Romania (2008) is also one of the states’ concerns.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Some countries, like Canada (1994), are aware that children’s access to free-time facilities is unequal, especially for children
                     who live in remote or rural communities. Belgium (2009) subsidises community programmes that plan play areas and free-time
                     facilities with the goal of updating the dynamic of neighbourhood life and fostering encounters among generations and cultures.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Germany (2003) has a special association to defend the child’s right to play (Das Recht des Kindes auf Spiel). In Austria
                     (2011), too, there are several associations which disseminate and promote play, such as the Game Centre (Spielebox) and the
                     Institute for Free-time Education (Institut für Freizeitpädagogik, IFP). Italy (2010) mentions holding International Play
                     Day on the 28<sup>th</sup> of May since 2005, promoted by the National City and Play Association (Associazione nazionale Città in gioco – GioNa).
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Some countries show an interest in finding out children’s opinions via surveys. The children (Germany, 2003; Ireland, 2005;
                     United Kingdom, 2008; Italy, 2010) respond that they want more play areas and more opportunities for free time and social
                     life. They view play and recreation as important aspects of their quality of life. The report from the Netherlands (2008)
                     mentions that today, youths spend less free time in group activities in a public setting (on the street or on playgrounds)
                     and more on individual activities in private settings.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>The reports from Spain (2009), Austria (2011) and Germany (2012) announce that they have accepted the new Pan European Game
                     Information code.

               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>In Croatia (1994), Austria (2004), Spain (2009) and Iceland (2010), children and youths are banned from participating in gambling
                     in which they bet money.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>The report from Croatia (1994) mentions that there are several playrooms in libraries, museums and theatres in Zagreb. Croatia
                     (2003) reports that all public libraries now have these rooms. Also worth citing are the reports by Sweden (1998) and Spain
                     (2001), because they indicate that when a child’s illness forces them to be admitted into a hospital, it is possible to set
                     up spaces adapted to children which allow them to exercise their right to play.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>There is a concern regarding the loss of green spaces that allow children to play outdoors and in nature (Norway, 1998 and
                     2004; Canada, 2003).
                  </p>

            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>After the survey of the reports, we shall now share the content analysis of the 10% of the Final Observations which did refer
         to article 31. The following issues can be taken into consideration:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>The lack of recommendations for families and the virtual irrelevancy of comments in the area of school, given that only in
               a few Final Observations for Japan (2010) did the CRC express its concern with the tensions generated in child development
               by the existence of an extremely competitive educational system which leaves little room for free time, physical activity
               and rest.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>The social sphere is where the CRC formulates the widest range of recommendations for the States Parties:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>In the Final Observations for Greece (2012), the Committee is concerned with the failure to adopt measures that protect children
                     and adolescents from harmful information in relation to commercial products that can appear in toys, computer games and Internet
                     programmes.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>In the Final Observations for Austria (2012), it recommends that the state enact laws to control light child labour when the
                     school day is over, particularly in family businesses, in order to ensure the right to play, rest and free time.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>In the Final Observations for Belgium (2010), it notes the insufficiency of playgrounds and informal gathering and recreational
                     space, particularly in rural and remote places. Likewise, in its Final Observations for Ireland (2006), it expresses its concern
                     with the scant political and financial importance given to creating free-time facilities and with the fact that the increasing
                     demand for housing may hinder the creation of public play areas.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>It asks the United Kingdom (2008), Romania (2009) and Belgium (2010) to make an effort to ensure that children with disabilities
                     have appropriate play areas where they can engage in free-time and leisure activities. In the Final Observations for Belgium
                     (2010), it is also concerned that children from disadvantaged families, as well as those who require psychiatric care, may
                     be deprived to access to a full range of free-time activities.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>On the one hand, it notes with unease and observes with concern that in Romania (2001, 2006) the state has not paid enough
                     attention to article 31. On the other hand, it expresses its satisfaction with initiatives such as the National Play Policy
                     in Ireland (2006) and the fact that the United Kingdom (2008) has the highest investment in the history of the central government
                     of fostering child’s play within The Children’s Plan of England. Regardless the Committee recommends –such as for Japan (2010)–
                     that the states support initiatives that promote and facilitate independent play among children in public spaces, schools
                     and households.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Second Period of Study: Reports and Final Observations Issued Between 2013 and 2017</h2>
      <p>From the approval of General Observation No. 17 (April 2013) until 31 December 2017, the second period studied, a total of
         78 reports were submitted by the States Parties that have ratified the Convention. However, 69.23% of the reports lack a single
         mention of the child’s right to play. 
      </p>
      <p>After subjecting the content of the reports to a qualitative analysis, when referring to the child’s right to play, the States
         Parties state that:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>They do not pay any attention to this right. In this sense, we can cite the reports from Santa Lucia (2013), Ethiopia (2013)
               and Honduras (2014). The report from Ethiopia is utterly sincere and states that this is due to the lack of resources, the
               low level of community participation and the lack of recognition of this need. The Honduran report is also quite clear and
               openly states the need for national public policies to improve inter-institutional and inter-sector articulation, to be allocated
               more economic and human resources and to extend to all the communities and children in the country, particularly in rural
               areas.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Despite theoretically recognising its importance, in practice Turkmenistan (2013), Zambia (2015) and the Maldives (2105) do
               not push for either measures or actions that foster it. The latter believes that play should not be considered a luxury, but
               it states that the potential offered by free-time and recreational activities is not used sufficiently, and it does not conceal
               the fact that children spend much of their free time inside their homes playing electronic games or watching television.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>There is no measure, action, or state initiative that fosters play within the family.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>With regard to schools, several reports contain relevant points:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>The report from Singapore (2017) stresses the importance of recognising leisure and play in the school curriculum. However,
                     the report from Vanuatu (2016) expands and further explores this aspect by considering that early childhood care and education
                     call for principles and policy guidelines on recreational equipment and materials. In this way, children can play on adapted
                     facilities and equipment and have the opportunity investigate, experiment, discover and solve problems within a situation
                     of play.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>In terms of free-time facilities and school recreation, the report from Lesotho (2017) indicates that when the government
                     improved the country’s infrastructure, it attached due importance to including recreational spaces and facilities within schools.
                     The report from Gambia (2014) states that all schools should have such spaces and facilities so that students can practise
                     sports or other free-time activities. Not only does the report from Palau (2017) indicate the percentage of children who participate
                     in organised activities, it also reflects on the importance of these spaces of play by recognising that playgrounds were not
                     traditionally recognised since children were assigned household tasks and chores. The school system has introduced the promotion
                     of organised activities and has turned playgrounds into spaces where children interact, meet other children and learn from
                     each other.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>The reports from Nepal (2014), Ghana (2014) and Zambia (2015) indicate that recreational time at school has been established
                     and regulated.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>The report from the Netherlands (2014) shows the increase in the number of community schools (around 1,500 out of approximately
                     6,500 primary schools) that hold activities before and after school. These activities include play groups.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>In the social sphere, the reports reveal a wide range of situations:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>The report from Ghana (2014) mentions the concern with the lack of public play areas and indicates that it is ironic that
                     children in rural zones have enough room to play but no toys, while children in urban areas have toys but often lack spaces
                     where they can play. The report from Bangladesh (2014) openly recognises that many poor and disadvantaged children continue
                     to be deprived of opportunities for leisure, recreation, games and cultural activities.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Conversely, the reports from Maldives (2015), Lebanon (2016), Belgium (2017) and Italy (2017) report on the creation or intention
                     to create public spaces equipped with safe, inclusive games. The report from Ireland (2015) stands out by stating the existence
                     of a national plan to create or improve playgrounds and the fact that local authorities have established policies on play.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>One way of increasing the public play areas is the one contained in the report from Brazil (2014) with the existence of the
                     Escola Aberta programme. Its goal is to make the public primary and secondary school located in urban regions afflicted by
                     violence and social vulnerability available to the entire community at weekends. This same initiative is being carried out
                     in Japan (2017), but play may not fit into these spaces since, as gleaned from its report, activities like learning, interacting
                     with nature and cultural, artistic, sport and other kinds of activities are held in the open Japanese playgrounds. However,
                     there is no reference to play.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Another interesting aspect worth bearing in mind is related to the use and enjoyment of free time. The report from the Netherlands
                     (2014) refers to the lack of free time among youths. The report from the Solomon Islands (2017) reveals that children complain
                     about a lack of free time because they have to spend that time on household chores and homework. Coupled with this lack of
                     time is the problem of how it is used. The report from Mongolia (2016) warns about the fact that the main place where adolescents
                     and youths spend their time is virtual gaming centres.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>During this second phase of the study (2013-2017), the CRC has issued a total of 96 Final Observations to the same number
         of States Parties. In 72.91% of the Final Observations, the CRC has not issued an opinion on the child’s right to play. Only
         in 21.87% of the Final Observations does the CRC refer explicitly and directly to General Observation No. 17, while in the
         remaining 5.22% of Final Observations the Committee does mention article 31.
      </p>
      <p>A qualitative comparative analysis of the Final Observations issued by the Committee leads us to point out that:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p> Recommendations or observations for the States Parties in reference to the child’s right to play within the family are non-existent.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>t school, the Committee is profoundly concerned –Iran (2016) and Maldives (2016)– with discrimination against girls because
               they have a very limited right to participate in free-time and leisure activities, both inside and outside school. In the
               Final Observations for Honduras (2015), the Committee further fleshes out this standard by indicating that the few spaces
               available for recreation in this country lack a gender perspective and often exclude girls. In addition to the recommendation
               to provide recreational spaces both inside and outside schools –Honduras (2015)– the Committee also suggests –Gambia (2015)–
               that schools offer children sports, leisure and cultural activities.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>In the social sphere, the Committee makes a range of observations:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>In the Final Observations for Venezuela (2015), Tajikistan (2017), Bhutan (2017) and the Democratic Republic of Korea (2017),
                     it recommends that the state should guarantee the implementation of policies on play and leisure which are allocated sufficient,
                     sustainable resources, and which provide for time and spaces so that children can participate in play and in the recreational
                     activities of their choice.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>It encourages Uruguay (2015), the Dominican Republic (2015), Chile (2015) and New Zealand (2017) to take the measures needed
                     to ensure that all children, without exception, including adolescents, have access to a public space that is appropriate for
                     play and recreational, cultural and sports activities, while it asks Yemen (2014) to guarantee that children have play time
                     after school and on vacation.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>It encourages the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland (2016) and Ecuador (2017) to hold consultations with the goal of getting
                     children fully involved in the planning, formulation and monitoring of the implementation of policies on play and free time
                     at the community, local and national level.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In short, on the one hand, the Committee celebrates the initiative of the government of Wales –United Kingdom and Northern
         Ireland (2016)– to adopt a policy on play which includes the child’s right to play in the relevant legislation, while on the
         other hand it recommends that Indonesia (2014) pay due attention to this right. To do so, the States Parties –as the Committee
         requests of Bangladesh (2015)– should assign all the human, technical and financial resources needed to initiatives that promote
         and facilitate children’s play time in public spaces, schools and homes.
      </p>
      <h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
      <p>For the time being, the entry into force of General Observation No. 17 has not led to a significant change in which the States
         Parties’ pay greater attention to the child’s right to play. The Committee has slightly increased the number of recommendations,
         but it still draws the States Parties’ attention to the need to comply with article 31 in a very limited way. 
      </p>
      <p>The international scene tells us that there are some countries with good practices (Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Ireland,
         Netherlands, Sweden and United Kingdom), but based on the reports and Final Observations, the majority of the States Parties
         violate the obligation to fulfil article 31. To make matters worse, there are states that openly recognise that they do not
         pay attention to this right due to a lack of recognition of this need (Ethiopia, 2013).
      </p>
      <p>The reports have shown the little prominence and consideration given to play in the family. In school, the establishment and
         regulation of school recreational time and having better free-time facilities are achievements. However, oftentimes schools
         lack inclusive playgrounds. Furthermore, little importance is attached to independent play in educational systems and plans.
         The social sphere is where most initiatives have taken place. The spectrum of situations is broad, from States Parties that
         are sensitive to the importance of this right to others that do not pay it sufficient attention. It is very common for leisure
         policies not to take account of the states’ child policies, and thus legislative and financial measures are lacking.
      </p>
      <p>The reports primarily cite play areas. However, there are few references to playtime, and even less mention is made of play
         materials and playmates. Play should be viewed holistically because having the right spaces may foster it, but they do not
         guarantee child play, which requires time, materials and playmates to reinforce free-time activity.
      </p>
      <p>One essential factor that cannot be ignored is that the States Parties provide information without making it fully clear whether
         they are achievements or statements of intentions. There are virtually no comments on laws and regulations that encourage,
         finance or regulate the child’s right to play. The reports primarily point out measures and actions, but the plans and projects
         within which they should be framed in order to foster and develop them are described in a highly ambiguous fashion, and if
         the processes are not clearly shown, the results achieved cannot be reported in a clear, transparent fashion.
      </p>
      <p>Proof of this is, for example, the fact that in the guidelines on drafting the reports, the States Parties are asked to report
         on the number/percentage of children in extracurricular activities; on the number of public playgrounds in the communities
         and whether they are in rural or urban settings; and on the number/percentage of children who participate in organised leisure,
         sports, cultural and artistic activities, and whether they are in rural or urban settings. However, despite the obligation
         to do this, the States Parties provide no statistical information.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, two of them refer to extracurricular and organised activities, which is far from article 31’s intention to promote
         autonomous play unsupervised by adults. Despite this observation, the guidelines do have indicators. However, it may be questionable
         whether three indicators are enough, because “to improve something you have to first measure it” (Adamson,<a href="#" id="bib1">2007</a>, p. 3).
      </p>
      <p>One of the first experiments with indicators is the one promoted by the Annie E. Casey Foundation (1990) with the publication
         of an annual report entitled <i>Kids Count Data Book</i> on child welfare in the United States. A significant leap in terms of the need to evaluate using indicators was taken when
         the CRC (2003), in the General Measures to Implement the Convention, proclaimed the urgency of gathering sufficient, reliable
         data on children which encompasses all of childhood until the age of 18, as well as including the monitoring mechanisms which
         make it possible to prove the enforcement of the rights within the evaluation system itself. A quick response to the CRC’s
         call was presented in the study by  (<a href="#" id="bib28">Ochaíta &amp; Espinosa, 2004</a>) which proposed different basic dimensions of the indicators on child welfare. In 2006, UNICEF’s Innocenti Research Centre
         developed a system of child welfare indicators, and this proposal was further specified one year later in Report Card 7 (<a href="#" id="bib1">Adamson, 2007</a>). Another reference is the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) proposal for a system of indicators on the
         protection, respect and promotion of the rights of the child in the EU (FRA, <a href="#" id="bib12">2009</a>). In parallel, several years ago the International Society for Childhood Indicators (ISCI) launched a working group, in conjunction
         with UNICEF among its promoters, with the purpose of encouraging the collection of international data among children aged
         8, 10 and 12. The specific objective of that project, called “The International Survey of Children’s Well-Being” (ISCWeB),
         is to gather reliable, representative data on the lives of children and their everyday activities, their use of time and particularly
         their perception of their own wellbeing. Within Europe, (<a href="#" id="bib5">Bradshaw &amp; Richardson, 2009</a>) use seven dimensions to organise the indicators: education, health, material resources, family and social setting, behaviours
         and risks, personal relationships and subjective wellbeing. Therefore, as  (<a href="#" id="bib4">Ben-Arieh, 2008</a>) notes, we can see a gradual increase in the scholarly literature on childhood and adolescence, such that the descriptor
         “child indicators” is appearing more frequently in scholarly databases. Furthermore, the aforementioned International Society
         for Child Indicators (ISCI) has an international journal entitled <i>Child Indicators Research </i> (CIR). Therefore, we can claim that “The Child Indicators Movement” is gradually gaining momentum.
      </p>
      <p>However, the indicators referring to free-time activity are absent or only barely present in scholarly or academic studies
         (<a href="#" id="bib9">Corona &amp; Gülgönen, 2013</a>; <a href="#" id="bib34">Tuñon, 2014</a>), in state statistical data and in plans, programmes and actions on policies for children. This absence confirms not only
         the need to promote the recognition of children’s universal right to play but also the urgency of having an effective tool
         –such as the formulation of a system of indicators– to evaluate it.
      </p>
      <h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>
      <p>Policies in favour of children in which play is ignored cannot be developed. It is indeed possible to cite other priorities
         or urgencies, but it still makes no sense because the ones who most need to have play as a major ally to contribute to their
         development are the most disadvantaged children, the most vulnerable ones, the ones who live in poverty, who grow without
         the care of their parents, who suffer from various kinds of exploitation, violence, abuse or mistreatment.
      </p>
      <p>The lack of play in under-developed countries where children are largely faceless is mentioned repeatedly. However, albeit
         in a very different way, the welfare society often skews compliance with the right to play based on the lack of time for play
         by prioritising extracurricular activities, pressure from parents or the lack of places to play, just to cite a few of the
         most common problems. Identifying the difficulties in exercising this right in advanced societies is also a challenge.
      </p>
      <p>By managing to formulate a system of indicators to evaluate recognition of the child’s right to play  (<a href="#" id="bib29">Payà &amp; Bantulà, 2019</a>), it will be possible to have benchmarks or points of reference to monitor compliance with this right, enable it to be evaluated
         and suggest both the inclusion of indicators of child play in indices and indicators of childhood and ensure that play is
         part of the objectives, goals and strategies of the action plans in favour of children.
