      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p>Setting expectations is a common human practice which affects many domains, such as education, economics, health, income,
         etc.  (<a href="#" id="bib7">Delavande, 2014</a>). In the present research paper, the generation of these expectations in respect to the education system, by both students
         and parents, will be accounted for, together with their ulterior influence on the total number of years of schooling achieved.
         This is particularly relevant, to the extent that human capital accumulation is a key contribution to socio-economic growth
         (<a href="#" id="bib4">Čadil, Petkovová, &amp; Blatná, 2014</a>).
      </p>
      <p>Students are constantly generating expectations during their progression through the academic track  (<a href="#" id="bib10">Eskelä-Haapanen, Vasalampi, &amp; Lerkkanen, 2020</a>), and previous literature has highlighted the relevance that students’ expectations have on their academic performance. In
         this sense, authors such as  (<a href="#" id="bib46">Zafar, 2011</a>) or  (<a href="#" id="bib21">Khattab, 2015</a>) found that students’ expectations are positively related to students’ academic achievement in the short run. Moreover, students’
         expectations have also been found to be relevant in explaining other future outcomes, such as satisfaction with education
         (<a href="#" id="bib1">Appleton-Knapp &amp; Krentler, 2006</a>; <a href="#" id="bib26">Marimon, Mas-Machuca, &amp; Berbegal-Mirabent, 2020</a>; <a href="#" id="bib27">Maskey, 2012</a>; <a href="#" id="bib42">Sanders, Field, &amp; Diego, 2001</a>).
      </p>
      <p>Parental expectations also seem to be relevant in explaining students’ academic achievement. In fact, authors such as  (<a href="#" id="bib28">Ma, 2001</a>) or <a href="#" id="bib40">Rubie-Davies, Peterson, Irving, Widdowson, and Dixon (2010)</a> highlighted that they are more relevant than student, peer or teacher expectations in determining students’ future academic
         outcomes. In fact,  (<a href="#" id="bib11">Fan &amp; Chen, 2001</a>) performed a meta-analysis of 25 research papers on the influence of parental involvement on students’ academic achievement,
         finding that parental expectations (considered as a dimension of this involvement) had the strongest association with students’
         academic outcomes. Additional meta-analyses have also reached the conclusion that parental expectations have a high influence
         on students’ academic achievement (a meta-analysis of 50 studies for middle-school by  (<a href="#" id="bib14">Hill &amp; Tyson, 2009</a>), one of 41 studies for elementary school students by  (<a href="#" id="bib18">Jeynes, 2005</a>), or another one by  (<a href="#" id="bib20">Jeynes, 2007</a>), for secondary school students, comprising 52 studies).  (<a href="#" id="bib5">Castro et al., 2015</a>)  performed a meta-analysis on 37 studies of kindergarten, primary and secondary education students, also finding that parental
         expectations were relevant for these students’ academic performance. Finally, a recent meta-analysis by  (<a href="#" id="bib36">Pinquart &amp; Ebeling, 2019</a>), using 169 studies on the influence of parental expectations on students’ academic achievement, found an effect size of
         around 0.30, which differed depending on students’ age, socio-economic status, ethnicity, matching of type of expectations
         and achievement, type of expectations assessed, publication status of the research work and informant. This was also corroborated
         by  (<a href="#" id="bib37">Pinquart &amp; Ebeling, 2020</a>), who updated the research to 261 studies. A similar effect size was found by  (<a href="#" id="bib6">Danişman, 2017</a>), who performed a meta-analysis on 67 research papers.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, the combination of both student and parental expectations seems to influence students’ academic achievement. In
         this sense,  (<a href="#" id="bib12">Hao &amp; Bonstead-Bruns, 1998</a>) indicated that the alignment between student and parental expectations positively contributed to students’ academic achievement,
         while differences between them reduced this academic performance. This was supported by authors such as  (<a href="#" id="bib25">Marcenaro-Gutierrez, Lopez-Agudo, &amp; Ropero-García, 2017</a>), who also analysed the influence that both student and parental expectations have on Spanish adolescents’ academic achievement
         and their future academic track, finding that their coincidence positively influenced these outcomes. More recently,  (<a href="#" id="bib22">Lindberg, Yıldırım, Elvan, Öztürk, &amp; Recepoğlu, 2019</a>) stated that the interaction between parents’ and children’s expectations contributes to children’s success by providing
         more parental involvement.
      </p>
      <p>Previous literature has indicated that these expectations are generated by both students and parents conditioned by their
         socio-economic characteristics  (<a href="#" id="bib24">Marcenaro-Gutierrez &amp; Lopez-Agudo, 2017</a>). For instance,  (<a href="#" id="bib25">Marcenaro-Gutierrez et al., 2017</a>) found, for Spanish adolescents, that girls’ higher achievement in both reading and mathematics was mostly explained by female
         students’ higher returns to their expectations.  (<a href="#" id="bib23">Li &amp; Xie, 2020</a>) found that educational expectations are much less dependent on family background in East Asian societies than in the West,
         in that parents and children in the former all tend to hold high educational expectations, irrespective of family socio-economic
         status. Besides,  (<a href="#" id="bib12">Hao et al., 1998</a>) and  (<a href="#" id="bib21">Khattab, 2015</a>) remarked that ethnicity and immigrant status may condition the expectations that both students and parents have; similarly,
         (<a href="#" id="bib2">Arbona &amp; Novy, 1991</a>) also highlighted that students’ gender and ethnicity influenced differences in their expectations. In fact, parent gender
         seems to interact differently with students’ expectations. As found by  (<a href="#" id="bib34">Paa &amp; McWhirter, 2000</a>), girls’ expectations may be more influenced by their mothers than by their fathers; following Bandura’s role-model theory
         (<a href="#" id="bib3">Bandura, 1986</a>), this may be due to the fact that students might follow the model of the parent who is more similar to him/her. This way,
         parental years of schooling, together with gender, have also been identified as relevant predictors of students’ future expectations
         (<a href="#" id="bib44">Tavani &amp; Losh, 2003</a>). Regarding these socio-economic and cultural background characteristics,  (<a href="#" id="bib31">Neuenschwander, Vida, Garrett, &amp; Eccles, 2007</a>) performed a structural equation model using data of adolescents from Switzerland and the United States and found that students’
         socio-economic background and parental expectations play a relevant role in determining students’ self-concept and students’
         academic achievement. OECD (<a href="#" id="bib32">2020</a>) also indicated that adolescents who do not expect to complete higher education were more present among low socio-economic
         background students.
      </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, socio-economic characteristics and students’ cognitive skills (measured using, for example, Intelligence Quotient,
         IQ) are not the only ones that play a relevant role in generating these expectations; students’ non-cognitive skills, also
         known as soft skills, are also important  (<a href="#" id="bib13">Heckman &amp; Kautz, 2012</a>; <a href="#" id="bib39">Robles, 2012</a>). However, in spite of their relevance, these soft skills have been frequently disregarded in studies on education expectations,
         either because their relevance was underestimated or due to a lack of measures of these skills in the datasets. Because of
         that, authors such as  (<a href="#" id="bib43">Schulz, 2008</a>) or   (<a href="#" id="bib45">Thurner &amp; Böttcher, 2012</a>), among others, indicated that the lack of attention that these soft skills receive in the education system may alter students’
         expectations, to the extent that students may not be aware of other important capabilities they have besides cognitive skills.
         This underestimation of soft skills has also been found to influence students’ employment expectations and perceptions regarding
         the value that employers give to these skills  (<a href="#" id="bib8">Dolce, Emanuel, Cisi, &amp; Ghislieri, 2020</a>; <a href="#" id="bib17">Itani &amp; Srour, 2016</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>In this context, this research study intends to analyse the influence that both student and parental expectations have on
         the years of schooling that students finally achieve. To this end, a structural equation model is used, in which three equations
         are defined: the main one, explaining students’ years of schooling, and two others that reproduce the generation process of
         both student and parental expectations. The last two equations account for the previously described variables which may potentially
         condition the generation of these expectations (socio-economic characteristics, cognitive skills and soft skills).
      </p>
      <p>The present study is focused on the region of Andalusia, which is the most populated region of Spain (8.4 million people in
         2019). In addition, this region presents low results in large-scale international assessment tests and very high dropout rates:
         around 23.5% of students had dropped out of compulsory education in 2017, which is 5.2% higher than the rate for Spain (IECA,
         <a href="#" id="bib15">2020</a>). In this sense, in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 (MECD, <a href="#" id="bib29">2020</a>; OECD,<a href="#" id="bib33">2019</a>), Andalusian students obtained 466 points in reading (compared to 477 for Spain and 487 for the OECD), 467 in mathematics
         (481 for Spain and 489 for the OECD) and 471 in science (483 for Spain and 489 for the OECD). Hence, this region represents
         a valuable case study to understand the sources of academic success. 
      </p>
      <p>Concretely, the present study intends to answer the following question: Are both student and parental expectations in secondary
         education influencing the years of schooling finally achieved by Andalusian students?
      </p>
      <p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows: first, the dataset and methodology employed are described, followed by the
         results, their discussion and conclusions.
      </p>
      <h1>METHODS</h1>
      <p>The methodology employed for this research study is a structural equation model, which is estimated using three-stage least
         squares. This methodology has been chosen because it is assumed that the generation of expectations about students’ years
         of schooling is different for the student and the parent, so two different equations for each group of expectations are needed.
         Then, student and parental expectations interact and, together with other variables related to socio-economic characteristics,
         cognitive and soft skills, determine the years of education that students finally achieve. Therefore, the base model would
         be defined by the following structural equation model, which is composed of 3 equations:
      </p>
      <p><i>Y<sub>i </sub> = STU_EXP<sub>i </sub> + PA_EXP<sub>i</sub> + R<sub>i</sub> + X<sub>i</sub> + SCH<sub>i</sub> + </i><i>ε</i>1<i><i>i</i></i></p>
      <p><i>STU_EXP<sub>i </sub> = STU_A<sub>i </sub> + X<sub>i </sub> + SCH<sub>i </sub> + ε</i>2<i>i</i></p>
      <p>where <i>Y<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>STU_EXP<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>PA_EXP<sub>i</sub></i> are endogenous variables, while <i>R<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>X<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>SCH<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>STU_A<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>IN<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>PA_A<sub>i</sub></i> are exogenous variables (which are used as instruments);  represents the student; are the years of schooling achieved at
         age 23-24; <i>STU_EXP<sub>i</sub></i> are students’ expectations at age 15-16 about their years of schooling; <i> PA_EXP<sub>i</sub></i> are parental expectations at age 15-16 about their children’s years of schooling; <i>R<sub>i </sub></i> are the reasons given by the student for not achieving a higher number of years of schooling at age 23-24; <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> are student socio-economic background characteristics (sex, immigrant status, grade retention, study room at home, computer
         and Internet at home, TV at home, video or DVD player at home, consult books at home, father years of schooling, mother years
         of schooling, level of income of the household, living with parents at home, reading and mathematics scores when aged 14-15,
         attitudes towards reading); <i>SCH<sub>i</sub></i> are school characteristics at age 15-16 (school funding); <i>STU_A<sub>i</sub></i> are students’ assessments of their soft skills at age 15-16 (sports, music and arts, relationships, street knowledge, manual
         skills, sensitivity, courage); <i>IN<sub>i</sub></i> indicates who answered the parental questionnaire at age 15-16 (the mother, the father, the stepmother or the stepfather);
         <i>PA_A<sub>i</sub></i> are parental assessments of their child as a student and of his/her soft skills at age 15-16 (sports, music and arts, relationships,
         street knowledge, manual skills, sensitivity, courage); <i>ε</i><sub>1<i>i</i></sub>, <i>ε</i><sub>2<i>i</i></sub> and <i>ε</i><sub>3<i>i</i></sub>, are idiosyncratic random error terms for each equation. Therefore, all variables were measured when students were 15-16,
         with the exception of <i>Y<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>R<sub>i</sub></i>, which were measured when students were 23-24, and students’ reading and mathematics scores, which were measured when students
         were 14-15.
      </p>
      <p>The underlying idea in the specification of this structural equation model is that both student cognitive skills (such as
         ability) are proxied by student’s actual scores in reading and mathematics when they were aged 14-15, and soft skills are
         proxied by the opinion of the student and the parent (respectively) on the student’s soft skills. In this way, the potential
         issues in the estimations due to the omission of these relevant variables would be mitigated. However, to the extent that
         there may be some unobservables which are not controlled in the model, results will be interpreted as conditional associations
         and not as causal effects. 
      </p>
      <p>The estimations have been assigned using frequency weights to raise the sample to the population size and standard errors
         are robust.
      </p>
      <p>The data employed in this research study is taken from the 2010 and 2018 Social Survey: Education panel and transitions to
         the Labour Market in Andalusia (IECA, <a href="#" id="bib16">2020</a>). This is a panel in which a sample of 1,866 students born in 1994 took the first survey in the academic year 2009-2010,
         when they were in 10<sup>th</sup> grade (age 15-16); they were surveyed again 8 years later, when they were aged 23-24 (in 2018). The 2010 Social Survey contained
         student, parent and household questionnaires, together with administrative information about students’ scores in each subject
         and grade retention. These questionnaires are very rich in data and contain many variables which are a rarity in large-scale
         international assessment tests (like PISA) such as those related to soft skills. The 2018 Social Survey only contained a questionnaire
         for students, in which they answered questions about their current personal, educational and labour situation.
      </p>
      <p>In particular, this dataset provides key information on the number of school years achieved by the students in 2018 when they
         were 23-24 and student and parental expectations for these years of schooling in the academic year 2009-10. This information
         was coded in years in the following way:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Less than secondary education – 8 years of schooling.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Secondary education – 10 years of schooling.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>High school – 12 years of schooling.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Intermediate level vocational track – 12 years of schooling.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Upper-level vocational track – 14 years of schooling.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>University degree – 16 years of schooling.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of these 1,866 students, those who had some kind of health problem or special education difficulty (50 students) were dropped
         from the sample, together with those whose parental questionnaire was not answered by the father, mother, stepfather or stepmother
         –as parental expectations are being analysed– (26 students). Furthermore, student expectations present 5 missing observations,
         while parental expectations present 119 missing observations. Besides that, immigrant status has 2 missing observations and
         school funding has 2 missing values. This leaves a sample of 1,662 students. Sample selection between the students in the
         sample under analysis and those not included in the sample has been checked. This analysis is shown in Table A1 (Appendix,
         available upon request); as can be seen, there does not seem to be any kind of sample selection.
      </p>
      <h1>RESULTS</h1>
      <h2>Main results</h2>
      <p>Before presenting the results for the structural equation model using three-stage least squares, equation (1) has been estimated
         by only using ordinary least squares in order to see how not considering the generation process of student and parental expectations
         may influence students’ years of schooling. These results are presented in Table  1. As shown, one additional year of students’ expectations seems to positively associate with 0.17 students’ years of schooling
         at age 23-24. Regarding parental expectations, one additional year of expectations seems to positively associate with 0.10
         final years of schooling at age 23-24. Nevertheless, as previously indicated, the expectations’ generation process has not
         been taken into account in these estimations, which may mean that many unobservables might be biasing these expectation coefficients.
         For this reason, the base model is going to be estimated.

      <p>Therefore, a structural equation base model has been obtained using three-stage least squares in Table  2. In this table each column represents equations (1), (2) and (3), respectively. In the case of the results for equation (1)
         –which are related to students’ expected years of schooling– the table shows that one additional year of students’ expectations
         may entail 0.36 years of schooling at age 23-24, while one additional year of parental expectations may entail 0.49 years
         of schooling when the student is 23-24. These are relevant results, to the extent that if both student and parents expected
         a university degree (that is 16 years of schooling), this would boost students’ years of schooling by 6 years (when the student
         expects this level) and 8 years (when the parent expects this level), respectively. As shown, both results add up to 14, close
         to the 16 years of schooling reached when finishing a degree. This result might indicate that although educational expectations
         of both parents and student are important, parental expectations further increase students’ years of schooling. Another interesting
         result is that girls seem to achieve 0.13 years more of schooling than boys (which, although significant, is a relatively
         small difference). Furthermore, first generation immigrant students seem to achieve almost 1.38 years of schooling less than
         natives, and students who live only with their father seem to achieve 1.30 years of schooling more than those who live with
         both parents. Regarding the reasons provided in the questionnaires, the one which penalised to a greater extent the years
         of schooling finally achieved by the student (0.83 years less of schooling) is when the student stated that “at home they
         needed me to work”. The estimations provided in Table  2  have been replicated without including the reasons given by the student for not achieving a higher number of years of schooling
         at age 23-24 and results do not change (tables provided upon request to the authors).

      <p>In the case of results related to student and parental expectations (columns 2 and 3 in Table  2), the Table shows that although both students and parents expect almost one year of schooling more than natives when the
         student is a first- generation immigrant, these first-generation immigrants seem to finally achieve 1.38 years of schooling
         less than native students, as previously indicated. This high mismatch between educational expectations and educational attainment
         in the immigrant population (which is called immigrant optimism) has been documented for the Spanish case, noting that the
         later the student enters the Spanish education system, the higher this mismatch will be  (<a href="#" id="bib30">Miguel-Luken &amp; Solana-Solana, 2017</a>). In addition, girls and their parents seem to present higher expectations; as outlined by  (<a href="#" id="bib38">Reynolds &amp; Burge, 2008</a>), girls may feel more encouraged by their parents, which would enhance their educational expectations. Furthermore, being
         a repeater student seems to reduce both students’ and parents’ expected years of schooling by about 2 years. It is worth noting
         that the influence of grade retention on educational expectations is higher than its effect on years of schooling finally
         achieved. This result might be the consequence of the social stigma attached to grade retention. In addition, the model shows
         the influence of socio-economic characteristics on the formation of educational expectations. Specifically, parental years
         of schooling of both the father and the mother seem to be positively associated with higher expectations from both students
         and parents. Another variable used to measure family socio-economic characteristics is household income, which also exhibits
         a positive association with expected years of schooling by parents and students. These results are in line with previous literature
         which notes that social background exerts a positive influence on shaping educational expectations  (<a href="#" id="bib41">Salazar, Cebolla-Boado, &amp; Radl, 2020</a>). Another interesting result is that students who live only with their father expect (as well as their parents) to achieve
         between 1 and 1.50 years of schooling less than those living with both parents, although they finally achieve around 1.30
         years of schooling more than students living with both parents, as previously indicated. In this sense, the lower level of
         expectations of students living in single-parent families might be explained by less parental involvement in children’s education
         (<a href="#" id="bib9">Eccles, 2005</a>; <a href="#" id="bib19">Jeynes, 2005</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, students who achieve higher scores in reading and mathematics and read for enjoyment also expect (as well as their
         parents) to achieve higher years of schooling, and parental assessment of their children as students is positively associated
         with up to 2.4 years of schooling more when the parents assess their child with a 10. Finally, the results show that soft
         skills are significantly associated with both students’ and parents’ expectations. For example, students who perceived themselves
         as good at relationships, in manual skills and at being brave have lower educational expectations, while students who consider
         themselves as good at sports, at music and art, in street knowledge and those who defined themselves as being sensitive, have
         higher expectations. However, in some cases these soft skills influence differently the expectations of parents and students.
         For example, in the case of music and art: students who perceived themselves as good at music and art have higher educational
         expectations, while having a high level of this soft skill seems to reduce parental expectations.

      <h2>Robustness checks</h2>
      <p> In order to check the robustness of the main results, the estimations presented in Table  2  have been replicated including in equation (1) students’ assessment of their soft skills and parental assessment of their
         child’s soft skills (and also the assessment of the child as a student), alternatively in different specifications. The results
         on the influence of both student and parental expectations on students’ final years of schooling do not seem to change, which
         would support the main results.<sup>1</sup></p>
      <p>Because of the existing correlation between students’ test scores and some explanatory variables of the model, Table 2 has
         also been replicated excluding students’ test scores in reading and mathematics, and the estimated parameters do not change
         (table available upon request to authors).

      <h1>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</h1>
      <p>This present study analysed whether student and parental expectations in secondary education could influence (or not) the
         years of schooling actually completed by a student in the Spanish region of Andalusia. Concretely, this research study is
         novel in at least four aspects: (a) first, the rich dataset employed allows control over many variables which are not available
         in most education research data (e.g. soft skills); (b) it shows how student and parental expectations actually influenced
         the education paths followed by the student, as a panel dataset is available; (c) the use of three-stage least squares to
         estimate a structural equation model allows accounting for the formation process of both student and parental expectations,
         mitigating endogeneity problems; (d) this is the first study which analyses the influence of both student and parental expectations
         on years of schooling actually attained by students. In this respect, previous studies have analysed the effect of expectations
         on academic performance (short term effects).<sup>2</sup> Thus, this research goes further, since it explores whether educational expectations hold their effect in the long term.
         Results show that when both students and parents expect a degree level of education (16 years of schooling), the student seems
         to come quite close to achieving it.
      </p>
      <p>The predictive power of parents’ and students’ educational expectations is high compared to other regressors included in equation
         1. Variables related to household possessions have effect sizes of a similar value as parental expectations. For instance,
         a one-year increase in students’ expectations or having a computer and an Internet connection at home leads students to study
         almost half a year more. Therefore, they can be seen as substitutes in the education production function. It is worth highlighting
         that test score coefficients have a lower effect in explaining years of schooling (equation 1) than educational expectations
         (equations 2 and 3). This result may confirm that test scores exert their influence through educational expectations.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, these results are significant to the extent that both students and parents seem to play a relevant role in the
         final school level achieved by the student. This way, lower student expectations could be compensated by higher parental expectations.
         However, it was found that these expectations are not independently set by students and parents, to the extent that they are
         dependent on many socio-economic, cognitive and non-cognitive variables, which usually go in the same direction for both expectations
         and the final years of schooling achieved by the student; that is, they are in some way “realistic”. This is a relevant issue,
         insofar as these expectations differ depending on socio-economic status (i.e. they are lower for students from low socio-economic
         backgrounds), which could be a barrier to students’ resilience. Therefore, both students and parents should be aware of the
         relevance that expectations have on students’ future and try to keep them as high as possible. 
      </p>
      <p>Educational policy can shape the establishment of educational expectations in several ways. First, improving family economic
         conditions, such as household income and availability of educational goods, would be beneficial to increase educational expectations;
         for instance, the allocation of public funds to the provision of a computer and Internet connection at home may increase educational
         expectations of both parents and students. Other ways of improving educational expectations are related to academic performance.
         In this regard, grade retention is a particularly relevant issue, which penalises, to a greater extent, educational expectations
         than the actual years of schooling finally achieved. This difference should be attributed to the social stigma of grade retention.
         The high proportion of repeaters in Spain –28.7% of students have repeated a grade during compulsory education, and 33.3%
         in Andalusia (OECD, <a href="#" id="bib33">2019</a> ; MECD, <a href="#" id="bib29">2020</a>)– could lower the educational expectations of students and parents, in particular for those from a socio-economically disadvantaged
         background, which is the group with a higher likelihood of repeating  (<a href="#" id="bib35">Pedraja-Chaparro, Santín, &amp; Simancas, 2015</a>). Therefore, schools should look for alternatives, such as extra tutoring for children with difficulties, in order to try
         to avoid grade retention. More generally, any measure aimed at improving cognitive skills in adolescence is associated with
         higher educational expectations, which ultimately increases students’ years of schooling.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, studies carried out in this area will not only contribute to those related to academic success, but also to those
         that aim to identify and address the reasons behind the high number of school dropouts in Andalusia (and in Spain as a whole);
         consequently, further studies are needed in this area. Moreover, there is a need to conduct additional studies aimed at researching
         the factors influencing both students’ and parental expectations in a more detailed manner.
      </p>
      <p>The present study has some limitations: first, there may be some unobservables which are not controlled in the model, so results
         have been interpreted as conditional associations and not as causal effects. Second, this study has high internal validity
         for the Spanish region of Andalusia, but not so much external validity. For that reason, this study has to be replicated for
         other regions and/or countries in order to obtain results that are valid for them.

         <li>There are studies that analyse the influence of student and parental expectations on Andalusian students’ academic achievement
            (Marcenaro-Gutierrez &amp; Lopez-Agudo, 2017; Marcenaro–Gutierrez, Lopez–Agudo, &amp; Ropero-García, 2017), but they do not focus
            on long term academic outcomes such as years of schooling.
