      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p> Learning processes demand new strategies to engage with students and their educational needs. Research in this field has
         been increasing. Recent studies in higher education suggest that the knowledge people need to live, work, and to become competitive
         professionals in society is interdisciplinary and problem-oriented (<a href="#" id="bib15">Freeman, Becker, Cummins, &amp; Davis, 2017</a>). Similarly, the <i>OECD Skills Outlook 2019</i> (<a href="#" id="bib40">2019</a>)<b></b>points to the importance of using technology as a way of acquiring skills for the 21st century. At the same time, it reiterates
         the value of tools that help students to personalise and regulate their own learning. This implies the creation of educational
         environments that offer solutions to the issues raised by the digital era and the educational community, focusing on aspects
         that include the learners themselves, their learning processes, and course content  (<a href="#" id="bib45">Roschelle, Penuel, &amp; Shechtman, 2006</a>). Based on this perspective, several teaching methodologies and approaches have been developed that stress the importance
         of the teacher-student relationship as a key factor in educational co-design practices  (<a href="#" id="bib10">Bovill, 2020</a>; <a href="#" id="bib28">Kinzie &amp; Kuh, 2017</a>; <a href="#" id="bib30">Kuh, 2008</a>; <a href="#" id="bib33">Magolda &amp; Astin, 1993</a>). Whenever student-centred design is implemented, it is important that the students are the protagonists  (<a href="#" id="bib19">Gros, 2019</a>). Thus, the application of co-design techniques to foster participation, collaboration and co-creation between teachers and
         students at classroom level is essential  (<a href="#" id="bib10">Bovill, 2020</a>).
      </p>
      <h2>Co-Designing Learning</h2>
      <p>The term co-design is a complex one to define, as it draws on a range of perspectives. It refers to the collective creativity
         of knowledge, to the advancement of the implementation of technological designs that respond to educational needs  (<a href="#" id="bib19">Gros, 2019</a>) and to learning processes  (<a href="#" id="bib20">Hannon, Danahi, Schneider, Coopey, &amp; Garber, 2012</a>; <a href="#" id="bib31">Leinonen &amp; Durall-Gazulla, 2014</a>; <a href="#" id="bib43">Penuel, 2019</a>; <a href="#" id="bib57">Zheng, 2015</a>). Co-design procedures are linked to participatory and collaborative research methods  (<a href="#" id="bib10">Bovill, 2020</a>; <a href="#" id="bib19">Gros, 2019</a>). Their origins lie in the Scandinavian tradition, associated with instructional design, constructivist principles and connectivist
         theories  (<a href="#" id="bib38">Mor &amp; Craft, 2012</a>). For this reason,  (<a href="#" id="bib26">Kalantzis &amp; Cope, 2010</a>) argue that co-design-based strategies represent a shift in instructional practices, in the roles played by participants,
         and in student decision-making with respect to content. Currently, studies using this methodology are based on the production
         of learning materials, curriculum development, the creation of a product, or as a training system  (<a href="#" id="bib24">Janssen, Könings, &amp; Merriënboer, 2017</a>; <a href="#" id="bib29">Könings, Seidel, &amp; Merriënboer, 2014</a>; <a href="#" id="bib43">Penuel, 2019</a>). Likewise, Roschelle, et al. (<a href="#" id="bib45">2006</a>, p. 607) state that for co-design to take place, a number of criteria must be met. It needs to: (1) Involve concrete, tangible
         innovation; (2) Be developed through design-based research, participatory research or formative research; (3) Be flexible
         and potentially have different iterations; (4) Be the result of a participatory teamwork experience; (5) Respect learning
         cycles; (6) Include virtual or face-to-face actions to facilitate teamwork; (7) Require the participants in the process to
         assume responsibility; (8) Use complex data analysis and allow for the introduction of interdisciplinary methods, thus enhancing
         validity and objectivity. 
      </p>
      <p>From an educational point of view, co-design initiatives happen when teachers and students work together collaboratively to
         create course components and/or pedagogical approaches  (<a href="#" id="bib9">Bovill, Cook-Sather, Felten, Millard, &amp; Moore-Cherry, 2016</a>). From a practical point of view, there is no single way of delivering co-design. Different methods and tools exist, although
         there are similarities between them  (<a href="#" id="bib39">Mor, Ferguson, &amp; Wasson, 2015</a>; <a href="#" id="bib42">Pastor, Lozano, &amp; Gros, 2017</a>). In light of these considerations, recent studies show that this type of participation can promote deeper learning among
         students, as well as provide key insights to guide teacher intervention (<a href="#" id="bib19">Gros, 2019</a>).
      </p>
      <h2>Self-Regulation of Learning</h2>
      <p>Zimmerman's work (<a href="#" id="bib58">1989</a>) in this field was groundbreaking. His studies describe self-regulated students as those who are in control of their own
         learning processes, based on metacognitive, motivational and behavioural variables. At the same time, (<a href="#" id="bib36">Mccombs, 1989</a>)  emphasised the active role of students in selecting their own goals, planning strategies and evaluating their own learning
         performance. Consequently, there are different theoretical models that define self-regulated learning from different perspectives,
         and among these we should highlight the following: 
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Zimmerman’s cyclical model,  (<a href="#" id="bib59">Zimmerman, 2000</a>) and  (<a href="#" id="bib60">Zimmerman &amp; Moylan, 2009</a>). Self-regulation is organised around three stages: forethought, performance and self-reflection.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p> (<a href="#" id="bib5">Bandura, 1986</a>; <a href="#" id="bib4">Bandura, 1997</a>) and  (<a href="#" id="bib58">Zimmerman, 1989</a>; <a href="#" id="bib61">Zimmerman, 2008</a>). Self-regulated learning is a socially driven process, one in which the student sets her or his learning objectives, monitoring,
               regulating and controlling the acquisition of knowledge, being guided by goals and context.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Boekaerts' Heuristic Model (<a href="#" id="bib7">1995</a>, <a href="#" id="bib8">1996</a>). This model articulates psychological aspects, including motivation, emotion, metacognition, self-concept and learning.
               Here, importance is placed on task evaluation by the learner.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Winne and Hadwin's four-stage model  (<a href="#" id="bib53">Winne &amp; Hadwin, 2008</a>). It focuses on the way students' cognitive processing works when planning, developing and evaluating a task.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>The Pintrich model (<a href="#" id="bib44">2000</a>). This is a four-stage model for achieving self-regulation: forethought, monitoring, control and reflection.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Co-design procedures are closely related to self-regulation, in terms of flexibility and the pace of learning. According to
         (<a href="#" id="bib62">Zimmerman, 2001</a>), the main cause of student failure is an inability to self-regulate effectively. This assertion is in line with what was
         recently put forward by the <i>OECD Skills Outlook 2019</i> (<a href="#" id="bib40">2019</a>). For years now, various approaches have been taken towards the exploration of student participation in curriculum planning
         and design. The aim has been to incorporate student views on teaching, and to achieve improvements in a collaborative way
         (<a href="#" id="bib3">Bain &amp; Zimmerman, 2009</a>).
      </p>
      <h2>Technological Learning Contexts</h2>
      <p>Technology Enhanced Learning Environments (TELE) refers to contexts that facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and skills
         with the support of ICT  (<a href="#" id="bib47">Steffens et al., 2015</a>). With regard to technology, it is important to distinguish between course-specific resources and applications for group
         work. In this sense, it is necessary to consider which technological tools can be adapted to the characteristics of these
         methodologies and to student needs (Gros, 2019). Currently there are few studies that address the issue of technological applications
         used in co-design processes. Research is needed in this area to analyse what kind of tools can improve teaching-learning processes.
         However, more evidence has been found regarding technologies that favour self-regulation, showing that digital technologies
         have great potential for the development of self-regulation  (<a href="#" id="bib35">Marcelo &amp; Rijo, 2019</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>Accordingly, the aim of this study was to identify models of self-regulated learning associated with educational co-design
         in technology-enhanced learning environments. Through a systematic review of the literature, we aim to answer the following
         questions: Which models of self-regulation are associated with the co-design of learning in TELE? 
      </p>
      <p>Which models of co-design are associated with the self-regulation of learning in TELE? How are the relationships between the
         different agents involved in co-design in TELE established? What kind of technology is used to support the co-design and self-regulation
         processes?
      </p>
      <h1>METHODS</h1>
      <p>Systematic reviews seek to draw together all the knowledge in a specific area, highlighting what is known about a particular
         topic through the results obtained in different studies, and to provide recommendations regarding future research and practice
         (<a href="#" id="bib37">Moreno, Muñoz, Cuellar, Domancic, &amp; Villanueva, 2018</a>). As a first step, it is necessary to establish criteria to determine which articles are to be selected as part of the final
         sample, and which are not. To this end, the principles set out in the PRISMA declaration  (<a href="#" id="bib49">Urrútia &amp; Bonfill, 2010</a>) were taken into account. The review process was performed in four stages: 
      </p>
      <p><i>Stage 1.</i> Localisation of the articles. At this stage search criteria were established, and databases chosen: 830 scientific articles
         in English and Spanish, published between 2014-2019 were identified on the following databases: (1) Ebsco Host; (2) Web of
         Science; (3) Scopus; (4) ERIC; (5) Dialnet. Being aware that the terminology used to define this concept is extremely diverse,
         we chose to locate articles that specifically use the terms co-design, self-regulation and technology, thus configuring the
         following search string: Co-design OR codesign OR co design AND learning AND techno* OR computer AND self-regulation OR self
         regulation.  
      </p>
      <p><i>Stage 2.</i> Selection and eligibility. The purpose and the context of the research conditions determined the inclusion and exclusion
         criteria, as shown in Table  1. In order to apply these criteria, records from the databases were imported into the Rayyan QCRI tool, which allows the criteria
         to be applied collaboratively (Aveyard, 2007). Duplicates were eliminated, and an initial analysis was carried out using the
         abstracts of the articles. Those that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded, which left 197 articles for the next
         stage.

      <h1>RESULTS</h1>
      <p>This section presents the results in relation to the research questions posed.</p>
      <h2>Self-Regulation Models Associated with the Learning Co-Design Process</h2>
      <p>The concepts underpinning self-regulation models appear in the theoretical frameworks or in the conclusions of the research
         analysed. In a single paper, reference is made to one or sometimes to several models of self-regulation. Thus, there are others
         that mention the contributions made by Zimmerman, although they do not cite a specific model. Moreover, the term self-regulation
         appears without being linked to any theoretical approach (Figure  2).
      </p>

      <p>Each theoretical contribution proposes certain stages for the achievement of self-regulation, in which a series of elements
         appear. These are detailed in the papers. The processes and elements of the self-regulation models found in the papers analysed
         are specified below (Table  3):

      <p>The key elements that appear repeatedly in the processes of self-regulation are: Planning (n=17); Motivation (n=8); Organisation
         (n=6); Evaluation (n=5); Task execution (n=4); Goals (n=3); Cognition (n=3); Learning strategies (n=2). Other factors are
         mentioned once only. Planning stands out ahead of the rest (n=17). The term is to be understood from the point of view of
         organisation at the individual level. In other words, the self-regulation process begins with an analysis of the task, broken
         down into smaller units. Subsequently goals are set, and a personal strategy for how they are to be achieved is established,
         using prior knowledge as a starting point  (<a href="#" id="bib41">Panadero &amp; Alonso-Tapia, 2014</a>; <a href="#" id="bib60">Zimmerman et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, according to <a href="#" id="bib61">Zimmerman (2008)</a>, planning is the self-regulatory process par excellence, as it determines student success. Motivation (n=8) comes in second
         place, as a crucial concept for task planning and development  (<a href="#" id="bib41">Panadero et al., 2014</a>) .

      <h2>Co-Design Models Associated with the Self-Regulation of the Learning Process</h2>
      <p> The conceptualisations of co-design analysed refer to a collaborative process of course/curriculum design. The actions developed
         and the nature of the relationship between their components are what characterise each perspective. The co-design models presented
         in the papers reviewed and the concepts that underpin them are specified in Table  4:

      <p>The model that appears most frequently is collaborative (n=9), followed by participatory (n=5) and service-learning based
         co-design (n=3). Occasionally, collaborative and participatory models are mentioned in the same research project. Consequently,
         some authors consider that a rewarding design process needs to include both. In a similar vein, some research points to differences
         in this respect, specifically in terms of the degree of participant involvement. This implies that sometimes collaborative
         processes do not involve the introduction and discussion of participants' ideas. Actions are reduced to carrying out the assigned
         task. 
      </p>
      <p>However, for participatory design to take place, it is necessary for individuals to actively participate by expressing their
         opinions and providing input, thus enabling interaction with the group. Studies show a number of elements that appear in the
         co-design process, which are detailed in Table  5. The most common are collaboration (n=16), motivation (n=10), participation (n=9), planning (n=8) and goal setting (n=7).
         Other items are mentioned between (n=5) and (n=1) in the documents analysed (Table  5).

      <h2>Relationships Between the Different Agents Involved in Co-Design</h2>
      <p>The partnerships through which co-design actions take place vary depending on the project. Four types of interactions have
         been observed in the studies reviewed:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Between pupils. Takes place when a group of students carry out a task or work on a project together.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Between teachers. This implies the participation of all teaching staff in working on tasks or projects with the aim of developing
               them with the students.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Teachers and pupils. The interaction between the two groups involves taking decisions on the teaching processes to be followed
               during a class, an activity or a course.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Teachers and other professionals. At this level, co-design is achieved by means of contributions from both teachers and external
               experts on a given subject. Their collaboration generates projects, activities and outcomes for implementation in the classroom.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the records analysed, level one interactions occurred in 38% (n=8). At level two, interaction between teachers (n=7) 33%.
         At level three, between pupils and teachers (n=4) 19%. And at level four, between teachers and external experts (n=2) 10%.

      <h2>Technology Used to Support the Co-Design and Self-Regulation Processes </h2>
      <p>The research specifies the use of virtual learning environments to develop co-design and self-regulation actions. Institutional
         platforms, 3D virtual environments or MOOCs are used. The tools are linked to  (<a href="#" id="bib59">Zimmerman, 2000</a>) and  (<a href="#" id="bib60">Zimmerman et al., 2009</a>) cyclical model of self-regulation, as this is the one most frequently referred to. Thus, each is linked to the stages within
         this model, and in turn to the co-design models used. The applications used fulfil a series of functions based on the processes
         of communication, planning and/or organisation, task execution and reflection (Table  6).

      <h1>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</h1>
      <p>On the basis of the review carried out, the publications that address co-design and self-regulation within technological environments
         are scarce (n=21), which shows that the central focus of these studies is not technology, indicating the need to develop research
         in this field as pointed out by  (<a href="#" id="bib19">Gros, 2019</a>) , although the subject is beginning to be of interest. On the other hand, one of the objectives was to understand the self-regulation
         models that are usually associated with educational co-design. In this regard, the results indicate that only 8 cases are
         linked with a specific model, and that in most cases self-regulation is addressed without an approach having been chosen in
         advance. The perspectives related to co-design were participatory and collaborative models. These emphasise the importance
         of participation between students and teachers so that deeper learning can take place  (<a href="#" id="bib10">Bovill, 2020</a>). Projects have been co-designed by means of workshops or participatory activities, led and coordinated by teachers or researchers.
         The conclusions drawn from these kinds of experiences are intended to construct new knowledge that will facilitate dissemination
         and transfer in order to develop innovative designs. However, Gros (2019) warns that there are limitations to the publication
         of this type of research in scientific journals. The different studies analysed show that there can be different interactions
         and levels of co-design, depending on the degree of involvement of all the participants in the process. The following diagram
         shows the different interactions (Figure  3).

      </figure>
      <p>An analysis of the concepts related to the self-regulation of learning and co-design shows n=12 commonalities between the
         elements of each variable. At the same time, synchrony is identified between the most frequently reiterated items in the self-regulation
         and co-design models. Planning and motivation top the number of commonalities (Figure  4). 
      </p>

         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The acquisition of knowledge by the student is linked to participation, design, planning and motivation. In this case technology
         provides tools that support the process, although there are no specific studies on this (<a href="#" id="bib19">Gros, 2019</a>). Planning and cognition are directly linked to  (<a href="#" id="bib59">Zimmerman, 2000</a>)  cyclical self-regulation model and its subsequent revision by  (<a href="#" id="bib60">Zimmerman et al., 2009</a>). Planning is the quintessential self-regulatory process and is a predictor of task success. That is, the more time spent
         planning, the better the results  (<a href="#" id="bib61">Zimmerman, 2008</a>). Self-assessment is the student's evaluation of the validity of their own work. This is based on established criteria, and
         the achievement standard that has been set for the activity  (<a href="#" id=""></a>). These factors are also closely related to co-design, as if they are established beforehand, this will change the learner's
         perception of the task. Consequently, planning and motivation are linked to the learner's perception of his or her own learning
         in technological environments, and of the tasks to be performed. 
      </p>
      <p>The technological environments in which co-design-based projects are developed do not make reference to the concrete specifications
         of a model to be followed. But technology is emphasised as a support for graphic and visual representations, planning, the
         development of individual and/or collaborative tasks, and as a means of group communication. The research does not recommend
         or feature specific technological tools for developing co-design models. Instead, a combination of common tools is used in
         the stages of co-design, which are in turn linked to self-regulation models.

         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The results obtained through systematic review have enabled us to come up with the first draft of a co-design model that favours
         the process of self-regulation in technology-enhanced environments. Figure  5 shows sample size characterised by: level of co-design determined by interaction between the agents participating in the
         educational process (teacher-student-expert or other professionals); the roles and social relations inherent to participatory
         design; the stages within the self-regulation of learning based on  (<a href="#" id="bib59">22</a>) and  (<a href="#" id="bib60">23</a>) cyclical model; and the technology used to support the whole process.
