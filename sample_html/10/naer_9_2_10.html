      <h1> INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p> The increasing relevance of technology in business life and employment makes it increasingly important for teachers to integrate
         technology into their learning-teaching practices (<a href="#" id="bib30">Tondeur et al., 2017</a>). Today’s teachers are expected to integrate digital technologies to improve the quality of their learning-teaching activities
         (<a href="#" id="bib13">Guillén-Gámez, Mayorga-Fernández, Bravo-Agapito, &amp; Escribano-Ortiz, 2020</a>) as well as to become role models for students in the use of digital technologies (<a href="#" id="bib9">Ferrari, 2012</a>; <a href="#" id="bib28">Siddiq, Hatlevik, Olsen, Throndsen, &amp; Scherer, 2016</a>). Although many pre-service teachers were born in an environment where digital technologies are heavily used, this does not
         mean that they are digitally self-sufficient (<a href="#" id="bib21">Li &amp; Ranieri, 2010</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>Nowadays, digital competence is characterized as an indicator of quality education understanding in the 21st-century (<a href="#" id="bib23">Maderick, Zhang, Hartley, &amp; Marchand, 2016</a>), and its importance in being involved in the societies and economy of the 21st century is growing (<a href="#" id="bib25">Napal-Fraile, Peñalva-Vélez, &amp; Mendióroz-Lacambra, 2018</a>). Digital competence has to do with: technical information on the use of digital technologies, formal and informal digital
         environments of information in screening, assessment and management, communication and collaboration, digital content creation,
         digital media, providing safety, and problem-solving, job, employment, community inclusion, learning about digital technology
         to achieve the goals of critical, creative thinking, and in a confident manner (<a href="#" id="bib9">Ferrari, 2012</a>). <a href="#" id="bib16">Ilomäki, Paavola, Lakkala, and Kantosalo (2016)</a> state that digital competence encompasses technical skills, the use of digital technologies in business and everyday life,
         a critical assessment of digital technologies, and participation in digital culture. Digital competence includes taking advantage
         of the possibilities of digital technologies as well as dealing with their disadvantages (<a href="#" id="bib25">Napal-Fraile et al., 2018</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>Different models and frameworks have been developed to date in the measurement and diagnosis of digital competence. In America,
         the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) standards and performance indicators serve as an important guide
         for teachers to implement technology in their teaching practices (<a href="#" id="bib30">Tondeur et al., 2017</a>). DigEuLit model aims to define, structure and select tools related to digital competence for educators and students and
         funded by European Commission (<a href="#" id="bib2">Amaro, Oliveira, &amp; Veloso, 2017</a>). DigiLit Leicester has been developed by Leicester City Council to enable middle school teachers to transform classroom
         practices, leveraging technology to improve their professional development and identity (<a href="#" id="bib12">Fraser, Atkins, &amp; Richard, 2013</a>). Indicator Model for Assessing Student Digital Competence has been designed for measuring and identifying the digital competence
         of students in Spain (<a href="#" id="bib24">Muñoz-Repiso, Casillas-Martín, &amp; Gómez-Pablos, 2020</a>). Besides, Digital Competence Building Blocks (<a href="#" id="bib18">Janssen et al., 2013</a>), Digital Competence Framework (<a href="#" id="bib3">Calvani, Cartelli, Fini, &amp; Ranieri, 2008</a>), and the five-skill holistic conceptual model for digital literacy (<a href="#" id="bib7">Eshet-Alkalai, 2004</a>) have also been proposed for the development of the digital competence. In Europe, the DigComp framework for digital competence,
         which is seen as one of the eight key competences in the education process, has been developed (<a href="#" id="bib4">Carretero, Vuorikari, &amp; Punie, 2017</a>; <a href="#" id="bib31">Vuorikari, Punie, Carretero, &amp; Brande, 2016</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>The DigComp framework is based on 15 previously designed frameworks related to digital competence. It is one of the most up-to-date
         and comprehensive frameworks developed today regarding digital competence (<a href="#" id="bib28">Siddiq et al., 2016</a>). The DigComp framework was developed to help shape digital competence improvement policies and to be an instrument for planning
         education and training initiatives (<a href="#" id="bib31">Vuorikari et al., 2016</a>). DigComp encompasses meta-cognitive skills unlike other frameworks and models (<a href="#" id="bib18">Janssen et al., 2013</a>). DigComp divides digital competences into five different areas: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration,
         digital content creation, safety, and problem-solving (<a href="#" id="bib10">Ferrari, 2013</a>). In this context, “Information and data literacy” covers information requirements determination, the information in digital
         environments, search for content and data, critical evaluation, comparison, interpretation, analysis, storing, organizing,
         and processing digital information, content, and data. “Communication and collaboration” reflects interaction through digital
         devices and applications, sharing information, data, and content with different people, knowledge about resource representation
         and citation. It additionally includes the need to know that digital technologies can be used in official transactions with
         institutions, to be able to find social media, as well as digital and community networks digital content taking advantage
         of collaboration tools in facilitating the development process, how to pay attention to ethical principles when publishing
         the information, one or more of the benefits of having a digital identity, and knowing how the online and offline lives are
         linked with each other. “Digital content creation” refers to the ability to create digital content in different formats, to
         be able to express yourself through multimedia technologies, covers to be able to make changes to content created by others
         in accordance with the copyright, alongside knowing how to develop simulations, programming skills and software. “Safety”
         emphasizes being aware of the risks of digital technologies, paying attention to information privacy, being aware of privacy
         issues, and knowing the physical and psychological health and environmental impacts caused by the intensive use of digital
         technologies. “Problem-solving” requires to solve the problems in the digital environment, to choose the most appropriate
         digital technology, to be aware of the potential of digital technologies to create information and self-expression, and to
         have knowledge and expertise about the main technologies used in the field. 
      </p>
      <p>Today, the number of studies conducted to comprehensively determine the digital competences of pre-service teachers is limited
         (<a href="#" id="bib1">Alarcón, Pilar-Jiménez, &amp; Vicente‐Yagüe, 2020</a>; <a href="#" id="bib14">Gutiérrez-Porlán &amp; Serrano-Sánchez, 2016</a>; <a href="#" id="bib22">Lázaro-Cantabrana, Usart-Rodríguez, &amp; Gisbert-Cervera, 2019</a>). In the studies conducted, <a href="#" id="bib5">Casillas-Martín, Cabezas-González, and García-Peñalvo (2019)</a> examined how 332 pre-service teachers in Spain assessed their digital competences. <a href="#" id="bib15">Hinojo-Lucena, Aznar-Díaz, Cáceres-Reche, Trujillo-Torres, and Romero-Rodríguez (2019)</a> investigated whether the digital competences of 140 teachers in Spain vary according to variables such as age, gender, experience
         and branch. Following the digital competence training given to 30 pre-service teachers in Turkey, <a href="#" id="bib6">Çebi and Reisoğlu (2019)</a> determined whether the change in pre-service teachers' perceptions of digital competence varies according to the branch.
         <a href="#" id="bib25">Napal-Fraile et al. (2018)</a> analyzed the perceptions of the digital competence of 43 secondary school teachers who had a master's degree in Spain. <a href="#" id="bib20">Krumsvik, Jones, Øfstegaard, and Eikeland (2016)</a> investigated whether 2477 teachers in Norway had a relationship between their digital qualifications and their demographics.
         <a href="#" id="bib19">Keskin and Yazar (2015)</a> studied whether the digital competences of 286 teachers in pedagogical formation in Turkey vary according to their gender
         and branches. As a result of the research conducted, it was determined that digital competence training supported the development
         of pre-service teachers in different branches (<a href="#" id="bib6">Çebi &amp; Reisoğlu, 2019</a>). According to the branch, the digital competences of teachers (<a href="#" id="bib15">Hinojo-Lucena, Aznar-Díaz, Cáceres-Reche, Trujillo-Torres, &amp; Romero-Rodríguez, 2019</a>) were found to differ significantly. In addition to the fact that gender predicts digital competence (<a href="#" id="bib20">Krumsvik, Jones, Øfstegaard, &amp; Eikeland, 2016</a>), or in other saying, that pre-service teachers' digital competence varies according to gender (<a href="#" id="bib5">Casillas-Martín et al., 2019</a>), there are also results showing that they do not (<a href="#" id="bib15">Hinojo-Lucena et al., 2019</a>). In some of these studies, the digital competences of the pre-service teachers were examined in the context of their ability
         to use basic computers, the internet, to obtain information in digital media, and to know whether they have knowledge about
         technologies that have developed in recent years (<a href="#" id="bib5">Casillas-Martín et al., 2019</a>). In the studies carried out based on the DigComp framework, the digital competences of the pre-service teachers were examined
         descriptively (<a href="#" id="bib25">Napal-Fraile et al., 2018</a>) and the relationship of variables such as gender, age and professional experience with the digital competence was investigated
         (<a href="#" id="bib15">Hinojo-Lucena et al., 2019</a>). One or more areas linked to digital competence were evaluated. In a limited number of studies, all dimensions of digital
         competence have been taken into account, and studies have often been conducted within specific countries. For this reason,
         studies that comprehensively address the digital competences of the pre-service teachers, and which specifically express the
         deficiencies of the pre-service teachers and which areas are different according to variables such as gender, branch and perceived
         level of digital competence are required. Within this framework, the deficiencies in the scope of digital competence can be
         identified and suggestions can be made on how the content of training should be aimed at addressing these deficiencies. These
         studies must be carried out within the scope of different countries because the policies of each country regarding teacher
         training programs are different. In this way, each country can undertake necessary activities and initiatives in accordance
         with its own needs. In this respect, the research questions discussed in the study are as follows: 
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>What is the opinion of the pre-service teachers regarding their digital competences?</li>
         <li>Do pre-service teachers’ opinions on digital competences vary <i>a)</i> according to gender?;<i> b)</i> according to branch?; <i>c) </i>according to the perceived level of digital competence? 
         </li>
      </ol>
      <h1> METHOD</h1>
      <p>In this study, a cross-sectional survey model was used. The cross-sectional survey model is a research model which aims to
         know individuals’ opinions on the subject being examined at a given time (<a href="#" id="bib11">Fraenkel, Wallen, &amp; Hyun, 2012</a>). 
      </p>
      <h2>Participants </h2>
      <p>The survey involved 587 pre-service teachers from 51 provinces of Turkey who are studying in 63 different universities and
         who apply online for digital competence education. However, 69 questionnaires were not filled out properly and were not included
         in the study. The study was conducted within the framework of data obtained from 518 pre-service teachers. 79.2% of the study
         participants were female (n=410) and 20.8% were male (n=108). The average age of pre-service teachers was calculated as 22.06
         (<i>SD</i>=2.39). The branches of pre-service teachers were distributed as follows: 22.0% computer education and instructional technologies
         (CEIT) (n=114), 24.3% primary school teaching (n=126), 12.9% social studies teaching (n=67), 10.8% pre-school teaching (n=56),
         10.4% science teaching (n=54), 7.5% psychological counselling and guidance (PCG) (n=39), 4.6% mathematics teaching (n=24),
         4.4% Turkish language teaching (n=23), and 2.9% other teaching branches (n=15). Finally, pre-service teachers were asked about
         the levels of perceived digital competence, and the perceived digital competence level of 17.2% has been identified as low,
         68.5% as moderate (n=355), and 14.3% as high (n=74). 
      </p>
      <h2>Data collection tool</h2>
      <p>Digital competence questionnaire developed by researchers based on the DigComp framework was used as a data collection tool
         in the study. The questionnaire was prepared to cover five dimensions of digital competence (“Information and data literacy”,
         “Communication and collaboration”, “Digital content creation”, “Safety”, and “Problem-solving”). In the development of the
         questionnaire, a guide for DigComp prepared by <a href="#" id="bib4">Carretero et al. (2017)</a> was used. Two faculty members working in the field of digital competence were asked for an opinion on the evaluation of the
         questionnaire prepared in terms of scope and expression. According to the feedback from the experts, revisions were made on
         the items. Afterward, opinion was received from the expert in Turkish language teaching to evaluate whether the form was linguistically
         understandable. In addition, this questionnaire was used in the study conducted by <a href="#" id="bib6">Çebi and Reisoğlu (2019)</a> and was used in this study by making minor revisions on some items. It was a 5-point Likert-type questionnaire ranging from
         1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”). 
      </p>
      <h2>Data analysis</h2>
      <p>Descriptive and predictive analysis methods were applied in the examination of the obtained data. The assumptions about the
         analysis were tested before the analysis began. In this context, the normality distributions of the responses to each item
         were examined. Skewness and kurtosis values for each item were determined to be in the range between -1.361 to +1.464. Since
         these values were in the ranges specified by <a href="#" id="bib29">Tabachnick and Fidell (2013)</a>, it can be said that the normal distribution assumptions were met. Likewise, whether there was a normal distribution for
         each sub-group was checked in the analyses. The mean and standard deviation values of the attendance status of the pre-service
         teachers for each item were calculated. Besides, if there was a difference between the opinions of the pre-service teachers
         according to gender and branch was tested with the independent t-test and if there was a difference between the level of digital
         competence was tested with one-way ANOVA. In the analysis of the data, intergroup comparisons were made using the Bonferroni
         correction and the analyses were carried out with the IBM SPSS 25.0 software.

      <p>When the data in Table 1 were examined, it was seen that the average response of the pre-service teachers to the items in
         the areas of “information and data literacy” and “communication and collaboration” was 3.8 and above. However, both “digital
         content creation” and “problem-solving” areas of items had a relatively lower response average than other items. “<i>I develop content in simple forms using digital technologies</i>” item in “digital content creation” has the lowest average (<i>M</i>=3.22; <i>SD</i>=1.11). In the “problem-solving” area, “<i>I solve the technical problems I encounter when using digital media and devices</i>” has the lowest average (<i>M</i>=3.13; <i>SD</i>=1.01). When the means of items related to “Safety” were evaluated, it was determined that pre-service teachers generally
         pay attention to their and others’ privacy and personal data, and the mean scores of their opinions on awareness of the effects
         of digital technologies on health and environment were high. However, their response to deal with online threats (<i>M</i>=3.20; <i>SD</i>=1.10) as well as to protect the digital device and its content (<i>M</i>=3.56; <i>SD</i>=1.05) was found to be relatively low. In general, when all item averages were evaluated, it can be said that pre-service
         teachers’ digital competence was above the average.

      <h2>Examination of pre-service teachers’ opinions on their digital competence in terms of various variables</h2>
      <h3>Pre-service teachers’ opinions on digital competence according to gender</h3>
      <p>When examining whether pre-service teachers’ opinions on digital competence differed by gender, a significant difference was
         found in favor of male pre-service teachers in the other four areas, excluding communication and collaboration. 
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>In the items “<i>I identify my needs when searching for data, information or digital content in online environments</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="subscript-1">(516)</sub>=-3.134, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) and “<i>I access the data, information and digital content I need in online environments</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="subscript-2">(516)</sub>=-2.580, <i>p</i>&lt;.05) in the “Information and data literacy” area; 
         </li>
         <li>In the items “<i>I develop content in simple forms using digital technologies</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-a5195a5c6fce">(516)</sub>=-2.273, <i>p</i>&lt;.05) and “<i>I produce digital content by making changes to ready-made content</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-7a8a73ddf300">(516)</sub>=-2.522, <i>p</i>&lt;.05) in the “Digital content creation” area; 
         </li>
         <li>In the items “<i>I take different measures to protect my digital device and content</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-45c9f2b6073e">(516)</sub>=-2.906, <i>p</i>&lt;.01), “<i>I take precautions about safety and privacy in online environments</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-db7bcb94ce56">(516)</sub>=-3.201, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) and “<i>I know how to deal with online threats</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="subscript-3">(516)</sub>=-2.288, <i>p</i>&lt;.05) in the “Safety” area; 
         </li>
         <li>In the area of “Problem-solving”, differences were found in the items “<i>I identify the causes of technical problems I encounter when using digital media and devices</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-1241ea86acd0">(516)</sub>=-3.948, <i>p</i>&lt;.01), “<i>I solve the technical problems I encounter when using digital media and devices</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-13be84193bd2">(516)</sub>=-4.142, <i>p</i>&lt;.01), “<i>I use different digital technologies to create innovative solutions</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-8d7b6bbafe1d">(516)</sub>=-3.462, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) and “<i>I develop my digital competence by following new developments</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="subscript-4">(516)</sub>=-2.753, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) in favor of male pre-service teachers. 
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, the effect sizes (Cohen's <i>d</i>) for these significant differences were determined to vary between 0.218 and 0.445. In other words, the effect sizes, which
         are significant according to gender, can be said to be small. 
      </p>
      <h3>Pre-service teachers’ opinions on digital competence according to branch</h3>
      <p>The pre-service teachers of the CEIT branch, who have various courses in their curriculum related to digital competences,
         were treated as one group and the pre-service teachers of the other branch as a second group to examine whether their opinions
         on digital competences differ according to the branch. The courses taken by other branch pre-service teachers other than CEIT
         in the context of digital technologies or digital competences were similar and evaluated under the same group. As a result
         of the analysis, differences were determined in favor of CEIT pre-service teachers in all areas of digital competence. 
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>In the area of “Information and data literacy”, a significant difference was found in “<i>I identify my needs when searching for data, information or digital content in online environments</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-3ca2aa2bd55e">(516)</sub>=2.451, <i>p</i>&lt;.05) and “<i>I access the data, information and digital content I need in online environments</i>” (<i>t<sub id="s-f921cf5bafd4">(</sub></i><sub id="s-b0f3557f2be2">516)</sub>=3.103, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) items. The effect size was determined to be small.

This difference has a moderate effect size. 
         </li>
         <li>In the “Safety” area, the “<i>I am aware that I leave a digital footprint when I navigate online environments</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-09cefea71b44">(516)</sub>=5.630, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) item was determined to be the item with a larger effect size difference when compared to the branch. Furthermore, the
            effect size of <i>“I know what to look out for when creating a digital identity (profile) in online environments</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-2b8c5fddb637">(516)</sub>=4.467, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) and “<i>I know how to deal with online threats</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-9b4018851805">(516)</sub>=6.091, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) items was found to be moderate.

            had a small effect size. 
         </li>
         <li>In the area of “Problem-solving”, the scores of CEIT pre-service teachers were higher in “<i>I identify the causes of technical problems I encounter when using digital media and devices</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-075a6235dc4c">(516)</sub>=6.107, <i>p</i>&lt;.01), “<i>I solve the technical problems I encounter when using digital media and devices</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-b44d4b842453">(516)</sub>=5.764, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) and “<i>I use different digital technologies to create innovative solutions</i>” (<i>t</i><sub id="s-0258432a7706">(516)</sub>=6.007, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) items than those in other branches and this difference had a medium effect size.

But the effect size is small. 
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Pre-service teachers’ opinions on digital competence according to the perceived level of digital competence</h3>
      <p>It was determined that pre-service teachers’ opinions on digital competences, as a result of the analyses to check whether
         the level of perceived digital competence has changed, each item in the questionnaire changed according to digital competence
         and teachers who have higher digital competence than the others scored higher than others. Besides, it has been determined
         that there is a large effect size in some items which have a significant difference according to the level of digital competence
         perception. The effect size of the significant difference in the “<i>I can develop content in different formats (video, visual, animation, etc.) using digital technologies</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="s-75680cdcd475">(2,515)</sub>=57.810, <i>p</i>&lt;.01, η<sup id="superscript-1">2</sup>=0.183), “<i>I produce digital content by making changes to ready-made content</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="s-eb292b401284">(2,515)</sub>=50.289, <i>p</i>&lt;.01, η<sup id="superscript-2">2</sup>=0.163), “<i>I identify the causes of technical problems I encounter when using digital media and devices</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="s-a9ec6619f3c1">(2,515)</sub>=41.827, <i>p</i>&lt;.01, η<sup id="superscript-3">2</sup>=0.140), “<i>I solve the technical problems I encounter when using digital media and devices</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="s-dd26c51200ba">(2,515)</sub>=51.031, <i>p</i>&lt;.01, η<sup id="superscript-4">2</sup>=0.165), “<i>I use different digital technologies to create innovative solutions</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="s-88ee6cbd50c9">(2,515)</sub>=43.398, <i>p</i>&lt;.01, η<sup id="superscript-5">2</sup>=0.144), and “<i>I develop my digital competence by following new developments</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="s-3a0524874d00">(2,515)</sub>=42.558, <i>p</i>&lt;.01, η<sup id="superscript-6">2</sup>=0.142) items was found to be large. In other words, it can be said that according to the level of digital competence, the
         status of pre-service teachers to perform actions related to the areas of digital content creation and problem-solving varies.
      </p>
      <p>There was no significant difference in the “<i>I pay attention to copyrights and licensing when developing digital content</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="s-c771b1e66fcc">(2,515)</sub>=6.300, <i>p</i>&lt;.05, η<sup id="superscript-7">2</sup>=0.024), “<i>I protect personal data and privacy in online environments</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="subscript-8">(2,515)</sub>=7.612, <i>p</i>&lt;.05, η<sup id="superscript-8">2</sup>=0.029), “<i>I am aware of the effects of digital technology use on health (physical, psychological)</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="subscript-9">(2,515)</sub>=5.681, <i>p</i>&lt;.05, η<sup id="superscript-9">2</sup>=0.022), and “<i>I am aware of the environmental impact of using digital technologies</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="subscript-10">(2,515)</sub>=8.428, <i>p</i>&lt;.05, η<sup id="superscript-10">2</sup>=0.032) items between pre-service teachers with moderate digital competence and those with low digital competence. In these
         items, a difference only between pre-service teachers with a high level of digital competence and the other two groups was
         obtained. Finally, in the “<i>I comply with behavioral norms (ethical rules) when interacting in online environments</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="subscript-11">(2,515)</sub>=5.493, <i>p</i>&lt;.05, η<sup id="superscript-11">2</sup>=0.021) and “<i>When sharing my personal information online, I take precautions to protect the personal data of others (not to tag them in
            a photo without permission, etc.)</i>” (<i>F</i><sub id="subscript-12">(2,515)</sub>=6.102, <i>p</i>&lt;.05, η<sup id="superscript-12">2</sup>=0.023) items, a difference only between groups with high and low digital competence was found to be significant. 
      </p>
      <h1> DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</h1>
      <p>In this study, it was aimed to know the opinions of the pre-service teachers regarding their digital competence and to determine
         whether these opinions vary according to gender, branch and perceived level of digital competence. As a result of the study,
         it can be said that pre-service teachers’ digital competence item responses to the areas of information and data literacy,
         communication and collaboration, and safety were higher than the areas of digital content creation and problem-solving. The
         knowledge and skills of the pre-service teachers, especially in developing content in simple forms using digital technologies
         and solving technical problems when using digital media and devices, have a low average compared to other digital competence
         knowledge and skills. This may be due to the focus on theoretical knowledge in teacher training programs, lack of practices
         for content development and technical problems. The fact that pre-service teachers feel more advanced in the areas of information
         and data literacy, communication and collaboration, and safety may be due to their use of digital technologies in their daily
         lives in line with these areas. In the literature, it was determined that the pre-service teachers considered themselves to
         have a low level of competence in the areas of digital content creation (<a href="#" id="bib14">Gutiérrez-Porlán &amp; Serrano-Sánchez, 2016</a>; <a href="#" id="bib15">Hinojo-Lucena et al., 2019</a>), safety (<a href="#" id="bib14">Gutiérrez-Porlán &amp; Serrano-Sánchez, 2016</a>; <a href="#" id="bib26">Porlán &amp; Sánchez, 2016</a>), and problem-solving (<a href="#" id="bib8">Esteve-Mon, Llopis, &amp; Adell-Segura, 2020</a>). It was determined that pre-service teachers’ competences about searching information, screening and assessment, storage,
         and organizing (<a href="#" id="bib14">Gutiérrez-Porlán &amp; Serrano-Sánchez, 2016</a>), protection from threats that may come from devices and awareness of the physical, psychological, and environmental effects
         of the digital technologies, were good; competences in digital content creation, its integration, copyright and licensing
         were lower (<a href="#" id="bib25">Napal-Fraile et al., 2018</a>). It can be stated that the results obtained in this direction are in parallel with the literature. 
      </p>
      <p>In terms of gender, male pre-service teachers were better at information and data literacy, digital content creation, safety,
         and problem-solving. Males were found to outperform females in identifying and accessing information, data and digital content
         related to information and data literacy. It was determined that male pre-service teachers received higher scores than female
         pre-service teachers in developing content in simple forms and making changes to ready-made content in the area of digital
         content creation. It is understood that male pre-service teachers are better at taking safety and privacy measures online
         to protect digital devices and content in the area of safety. Concerning problem-solving as related to identifying the causes
         and finding solutions to the problems encountered when using technical devices, the use of different digital technologies
         to create innovative solutions and new developments male pre-service teachers were better than female pre-service teachers
         by following in the development of digital competence. This may be due to the fact that males are more interested in using
         digital technologies than females. In the literature, <a href="#" id="bib19">Keskin and Yazar (2015)</a> found that male teachers had higher competences in basic computer use and acquiring information in digital media than female
         teachers. <a href="#" id="bib8">Esteve-Mon et al. (2020)</a> confirmed that female pre-service teachers were less qualified than men in solving technical problems and programming. Besides,
         different studies have concluded that male pre-service teachers generally have higher digital competences than female pre-service
         teachers (<a href="#" id="bib5">Casillas-Martín et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#" id="bib13">Guillén-Gámez et al., 2020</a>). In this respect, it can be stated that the results obtained were useful in terms of paralleling the literature as well
         as specifically presenting the differences between male pre-service teachers and female pre-service teachers. 
      </p>
      <p>As a result of the study, it becomes clear that CEIT pre-service teachers have higher digital competences in all areas than
         other branch pre-service teachers. In terms of information and data literacy, they have higher scores than teachers belonging
         to other branches, especially in using information searching strategies to access information, data and digital content. It
         is understood that they are better at using digital technologies to work collaboratively online in the area of communication
         and collaboration than teachers framed within other branches. In the area of digital content creation, they were found to
         be better than teachers of other branches in developing simple and different forms of content using digital technologies,
         making changes to ready-made content and creating digital content. They are better than others in the area of safety in terms
         of being aware that they leave a digital footprint when navigating online environments, knowing what to look for when creating
         a digital identity (profile) in online environments, and how to deal with online threats. In the area of problem-solving,
         it was revealed that they achieved higher scores than teachers belonging to other branches in identifying the causes and finding
         solutions to the problems encountered when using digital media and devices, and in using different digital technologies to
         create innovative solutions. This may be due to the concentration of courses on digital competences in the curriculum of CEIT
         pre-service teachers. In the literature, <a href="#" id="bib19">Keskin and Yazar (2015)</a> found that the digital competences of using basic internet tools and obtaining information from digital media vary according
         to the branch, though CEIT pre-service teachers were not included in their study. <a href="#" id="bib6">Çebi and Reisoğlu (2019)</a> revealed that CEIT pre-service teachers were better at various competences in the lower areas of digital competence than
         teachers in other branches. This suggests that the results are in tune with the literature. 
      </p>
      <p>Significant differences were obtained in all areas of digital competence according to the perceived level of digital competence
         of the pre-service teachers. It was determined that the effect size of the difference in performing actions, particularly
         in the areas of digital content creation and problem-solving, was large. This effect has emerged in the items related to digital
         content creation, developing content in different formats using digital technologies, making changes to ready-made content,
         and producing digital content. It was determined that there was a difference in the levels of perceived digital competence,
         and this difference had a large effect in the areas of problem-solving, identifying the causes and finding solutions to the
         problems encountered when using digital media and devices, using digital technologies to create innovative solutions, and
         developing digital competences by following the new developments. In the literature, <a href="#" id="bib25">Napal-Fraile et al. (2018)</a> found that pre-service teachers having done a master’s degree did not consider themselves sufficiently qualified to develop
         digital content and integrate different content. <a href="#" id="bib17">Instefjord and Munthe (2017)</a> pointed out that pre-service teachers were expected to perform above their current digital competence in their internship
         schools at the point of developing digital content. <a href="#" id="bib27">Røkenes and Krumsvik (2016)</a> concluded that pre-service teachers need to be trained in digital content creation. Considering these studies in the field
         and the results of the current study, it can be said that pre-service teachers are lacking in the development of digital content.
      </p>
      <h1> LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS</h1>
      <p>One of the limitations of this study is that due to the collection of the data obtained through the survey, the analyses were
         done on an item basis and the results were evaluated through these analyses. Therefore, it may be useful to focus on the measurement
         studies developed to cover all areas of digital competence in future studies. Thus, research based on the cause-effect relationship
         could be carried out when generalizable results can be obtained regarding digital competence. Besides, it may be stated that
         the pre-service teachers should develop themselves in the areas of digital content creation and problem-solving in line with
         the results obtained from the study. In this context, in the training to be given about digital competence, the knowledge
         and skills to develop content in simple forms using digital technologies and to solve technical problems encountered while
         using digital media and devices can be given weight. In addition to these issues, it may be useful to pay attention to the
         information, data and identifying needs and those associated with accessing digital content, making changes to ready-made
         content, implementing measures to protect the digital device and contents, taking measures related to safety and privacy in
         the online environment, identifying the causes and finding solutions to the problems, and using different digital technologies
         to create innovative solutions by following the development of digital competence issues. It may be helpful to give weight
         to the training programs to be given other branch teachers, about using information search strategies for accessing information,
         data, and digital content in an online environment, using digital technologies for the purposes of cooperative work, simple
         and different forms of content development, producing digital content by making changes to ready-made content, being aware
         of leaving a digital footprint while browsing, paying attention when creating a digital identity profile in online environments,
         knowing how to handle online threats, identifying the causes and finding solutions to the technical problems encountered when
         using digital media and devices, as well as the use of different digital technologies to create innovative solutions. Practical
         courses and activities to support this knowledge and skills can also be added to the teacher training programs of different
         branches. In teaching practice courses, they may be asked to design activities that support the development of this knowledge
         and skills.
