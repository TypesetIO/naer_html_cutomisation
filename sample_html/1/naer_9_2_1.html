      <h1> INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p> The Internet and social networks have revolutionised literary reading. Nowadays, young people and adolescents do more social
         reading; that is, for example, where the reception process is shared through the net. Research has shown that literary reading
         is shared and commented on in virtual spaces 
         (<a href="#" id="bib8">García-Roca, 2016</a>; <a href="#" id="bib14">Jenkins, 2006</a>; 
         <a href="#" id="bib18">Lluch, 2014</a>; <a href="#" id="bib30">Torrego-González &amp; Gutiérrez-Martín, 2018</a>) and includes new literate practices such as writing <i>fanfictions</i> (<a href="#" id="bib12">Guerrero-Pico, 2016</a>), sharing reviews or theorising new content, to quote but a few. As will be discussed in this work, from the selection of
         a book to its final assessment, these are all activities carried out on the net. Undoubtedly, the decoding process still remains
         an individual act, but this is only a part of the experience of receiving literary works in the digital age. 
      </p>
      <p>Faced with this reality, school is put on hold and provides, on most occasions, teaching and learning proposals that are limited
         to the specific field of traditional literacy regardless of students’ actual interests (<a href="#" id="bib11">González, 2018</a>; <a href="#" id="bib16">Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2006</a>). Thus, the other literate practices, among them digital reading and writing, are relegated to the status of personal practices of little social, educational, or literary value. 
      </p>
      <p>The school canon (list of works proposed by educational centres and teachers) is totally dissociated from the actual interests
         of students: for example, no works of a digital nature appear in the school canon. Despite this, studies such as those carried
         out by <a href="#" id="bib23">Moral-Pérez, Villalustre-Martínez, and Neira-Piñeiro (2016)</a> show the educational potential of digital storytelling. This confrontation between vernacular and dominant or institutional
         practices was studied by <a href="#" id="bib2">Cassany (2013)</a>, who analysed their main respective features. The gap proves detrimental to the objectives of formal education and the promotion
         of reading habits, since the virtual spaces of reading affinity, as well as the activities developed in them, are unique opportunities
         to promote reading both at schools and in libraries (<a href="#" id="bib27">Rovira-Collado, 2015</a>). The new reality provides new possibilities for the promotion of reading, proposals for training in reading or literary
         education in general. 
      </p>
      <p>These new literate practices or new literacies are developed in virtual meeting spaces such as forums, blogs, or social networks,
         which, instead of using a clear hierarchy, are based on a more or less horizontal model (all of them start from the same status).
         However, circumstances such as the trajectory in the community, the number and relevance of contributions or their knowledge
         of a particular subject matter enable users to gain prominence, visibility and popularity within the platform or community
         in question. They become reference groups and their experiences with products and services are read and taken into account
         by a large number of users who follow their activities closely and trust their judgment. In this regard, as influencers have
         a say in a specific population segment (e.g. video games, fashion, or literature), they have been subject to a great deal
         of marketing-related research (<a href="#" id="bib28">Tanase, Tessone, &amp; Algesheimer, 2018</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>In the particular field of literature, the reading influencers most frequently studied have been <i>booktubers</i> (readers who share their opinions, impressions, and reviews of their readings on <i>YouTube</i>). These video bloggers act as trusted consumer motivators, mediators, or literary critics. Furthermore, users use everyday
         language, with lots of adjectives and, in short, a language close to their public (<a href="#" id="bib17">Lionetti, 2017</a>). Their social relevance has enabled them to collaborate with publishers in the promotion of new literary works. In addition,
         <i>booktubers</i> are young (15-to-25-year-old) people who encourage other youngsters and teenagers to read (<a href="#" id="bib26">Pérez &amp; López, 2015</a>). Note that this age group stands out for being the one with the greatest reading habit (FGEE, <a href="#" id="bib6">2018</a>), which is why it has been the centre of analyses in education-related studies (<a href="#" id="bib5">Ehret, Boegel, &amp; Manuel-Nekouei, 2018</a>; <a href="#" id="bib31">Vlieghe, Vandermeersche, &amp; Soetaert, 2016</a>). However, other specialists such as <a href="#" id="bib9">Garralón (2014)</a> question this <i>booktuber</i> system on the grounds that too much homogeneity exists regarding tastes, criteria, titles, authors, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>Since not enough empirical studies have carried out an in-depth analysis of reading influencers in Spain, the need arises
         to explore who these users are and what they are like? More specifically, this research was revolved around the following
         objectives: 
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Describing the general characteristics of the most relevant Spanish reading influencers.</li>
         <li>Investigating the activity, experience and participation of reading influencers on <i>Goodreads</i>. 
         </li>
         <li>Analysing the rating given to their readings in respect to other users.</li>
         <li>Exploring the canon proposed by the most influential <i>Goodreaders</i> in Spain. 
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h1> PREVIOUS RESEARCH</h1>
      <p>This research is based on one of the conclusions drawn from the <i>Hábitos de Lectura y Compra de Libros 2018</i> (Book Reading and Purchase Habits 2018) barometer performed by the <i>Federación de Gremios de Editores de España </i>(FGEE, <a href="#" id="bib6">2018</a>) namely: that the selection criteria for literary works has changed in recent years. From such perspective, this study (ibid.)
         shows that: 60.6% of the population older than 14 who read books look for information or recommendations on new books; out
         of these, 31.1% go to specialised literary websites for further reading; 19% access their social networks, forums, blogs…;
         5% search on the Internet as a whole; 3.8% read reviews in online newspapers; and 1% visit online stores or outlets. 
      </p>
      <p>The role of online pre-registration stands out, both in specific literary web pages and through social networks, forums and
         blogs (FGEE, <a href="#" id="bib6">2018</a>). In this context, the research undertaken by the <i>Asociación para la Investigación de Medios de Comunicación</i> (Spanish Association for Media Research) (<a href="#" id="bib1">2018</a>) reveals that 47.8% accessed the Internet to seek opinions and feedback (in which they place a great deal of trust) related
         to products and services they bought. 
      </p>
      <p>Among the new reading criteria stands out the importance of the Internet in general, specialised literary web pages and social
         networks. Therefore, this study has focused on interest-based social networks, that is, thematic social networks where the
         relationship between users stems from the existence of shared affinities regardless of place of residence, sex, age, etc.
         (<a href="#" id="bib10">Gee &amp; Hayes, 2012</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>In this regard, it is worth highlighting the study of <a href="#" id="bib32">Zhao (2017)</a> which shows that connections between <i>Goodreads</i> users are based on shared opinions and assessments of the same novel. In other words, they register on this social network
         because of their reading and writing hobby, groups being established according to literary interests. 
      </p>
      <p>There are plenty of reading cataloguing and social labelling communities, each one with its own different cultural rules and
         labelling practices (<a href="#" id="bib4">Desrochers, Laplante, Martin, Quan-Haase, &amp; Spiteri, 2016</a>): <i>Anobii</i>, <i>Lectorati</i>, <i>Leoteca</i>, <i>LibraryThing</i>, etc. Therefore, <i>Goodreads</i> (owned by Amazon) has been selected among all of them as the scenario for this analysis, as it is also the world’s most important
         reading cataloguing community. The same website boasts 80 million users and 2.3 billion books, the mobile application having
         10 million downloads in Google Play alone. Previous research found that the platform is mainly made up of women (<a href="#" id="bib29">Thelwall &amp; Kousha, 2016</a>). 
      </p>
      <p><i>Goodreads</i> is a space to meet and discuss literature (<a href="#" id="bib25">Nuttall, 2017</a>) where millions of users gather, united only in their fondness for reading. This eases the reception process and allows it
         to expand beyond the textual decoding by sharing opinions, experiences, and ratings. Throughout this process, reading and
         writing skills are serendipitously developed in informal education contexts (<a href="#" id="bib3">Cobo &amp; Moravec, 2011</a>), since users must read suggestions or assessments related to many literary works. 
      </p>
      <p>Appreciating the value of the collective view, readers share their assessment through a literature reflection exercise. These
         new scenarios additionally portray reading as a leisure activity to which an important level of social, emotional and intellectual
         involvement is attached (<a href="#" id="bib8">García-Roca, 2016</a>). Therefore, this whole reality represents a unique opportunity to propose literary education activities and to boost the
         reading habit. 
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, reading cataloguing communities are databases of opinions based on the principles of collective intelligence
         (<a href="#" id="bib21">Lévy, 2004</a>). From this perspective, as seen above, the opinion and rating of other users have become quality criteria to obtain new
         products and service (<a href="#" id="bib24">Naik, 2012</a>). Consequently, they are an important element in the promotion of a book that concerns all the actors involved and relates
         to reading: 
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>It does not only have an impact on its users/readers, but also on all the groups of people and bodies that are somehow involved
            with them: authors, publishers, distributors, booksellers, reviewers, public or private institutions, public offices, etc.
         </p>
         <attrib> (<a href="#" id="bib20">Lluch, Tabernero-Sala, &amp; Calvo-Valios, 2015</a>) 
         </attrib>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The boundaries that divide the traditional roles of reader, writer and literary critic on the platform are blurred, which
         results in new interactions between them. Users’ feedback becomes relevant to other potential readers and thus constitute
         a matter of concern for writers. 
      </p>
      <p>In this context, <a href="#" id="bib22">Matthews (2016)</a> analysed the incident involving a writer and an influencer who shared a negative review in 2012 with the aim of exploring
         how readers see the role of professionals in literature and which role non-professionals (readers, commentators, assessors…)
         consider as their own. 
      </p>
      <p>Despite being a priority line of research from the educational and cultural point of view, hardly any research has focused
         on the analysis of <i>Goodreads</i> users’ ratings. The research by <a href="#" id="bib15">Kovács and Harkey (2014)</a> studied how receiving an award or recognition influences reviews and ratings on <i>Goodreads</i>. For that purpose, their research examined thousands of reviews on <i>Goodreads</i> of 64 award-winning books between 2007 and 2011. It concluded that, since they were awarded the prize, literary works had
         undergone a sharp decline in text quality assessment. 
      </p>
      <p>This study is therefore an original contribution, since no research seems to have carried out an in-depth analysis of reading
         influencers, despite this being a relevant research topic. Furthermore, the achievement of objectives has important social
         and economic implications which are of interest to teachers, researchers, librarians, publishers, etc. 
      </p>
      <h1> METHODS </h1>
      <p>This is an exploratory and quantitative study, because of the number of cases analysed and the nature of the variables. In
         particular, a descriptive research work served to explore the characteristics of a user group. A systematic quantitative observation
         of the variables studied was performed for data collection purposes. The nature of data is fundamentally quantitative —with
         the exception of objective c., in which I studied authors and their books but also with a numerical bias. 
      </p>
      <p>A purposive sampling helped to select the population, insofar as these are relevant subjects: the platform provides and advertises
         the 100 most active, most followed and most important users in the community. They were the most popular reviewers on <i>Goodreads</i> in 2017 (a title achieved by obtaining the highest number of votes in their reviews). Data collection took place during the
         first four months of 2018. 
      </p>
      <p>Data from their user profiles such as age, sex, city of residence, number of readings, language of the profile and reviews
         or followers were gathered in a thorough and comprehensive manner using a data collection sheet, subsequently triangulating
         those data with the social networks they have indexed, namely: <i>YouTube</i>, <i>Instagram</i>, <i>Twitter</i>, etc. Data processing and analysis were carried out using the SPSS 23 software in order to perform a multivariate analysis,
         to search for correlations, to find differences between groups of users, among other tasks. 
      </p>
      <p>The <i>Chrome</i> browser extension called ‘Table Capture’ served to analyse the reading canon that these users propose. This tool made it
         possible to extract the complete list of all the readings that the influencers have shared, after which all the listings were
         linked in an Excel spreadsheet. Due to the large number of indexed works, a list of 94903 cells was obtained (note that there
         are 100 listings and many repeated books). By filtering the data to literary works that had been read and scored by the influencers,
         the data volume came down to 52564. 
      </p>
      <h1> RESULTS</h1>
      <h2>Socio-demographic characteristics</h2>
      <p>This section will examine the general socio-demographic characteristics of the top 100 Spanish influencers in 2017. The variables
         include: sex, age, autonomous region, the language of the profile and the language used in their reviews. 
      </p>
      <p>The most influential users when it comes to literary reading in Spain are mainly women. In fact, 79.5% of the users whose
         sex could be deduced (n=88) are women, the remaining 20.5% corresponding to men. In terms of age (Table 1), a large dispersion
         of data became visible. Firstly, there are users between 16 and 56 years of age (R=40). However, central tendency measures
         coincide: the mean is slightly above 33 years old (M=33), the median lies at 33 (M<sub id="subscript-1">e</sub>=33), and the most frequently repeated age 34 years old. Regarding the deviation of results in their distribution with respect
         to the arithmetic mean, a standard deviation of 9.747 (σ=9.747) and a variance of 95 (σ<sup id="superscript-1">2</sup>=95.002) were observed. No significant differences appear in terms of age according to sex.

      <p>Concerning the variable ‘autonomous region of residence’, it deserves to be highlighted that users are spread throughout Spain.
         Despite this, certain cities actually host a larger number of influencers. Four autonomous regions stand out in this regard:
         Catalonia hosts 21.1% of users (n=16); the Autonomous Region of Madrid hosts 18.4%, while Andalusia and the Autonomous Region
         of Valencia register 17.1% and 10.5%, respectively (Figure 1 ). 
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <figure><img src="grafico-1.png" alt=""/><figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Sampling distribution according to region 
         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p></p>
      <p>Despite all users being Spanish, the <i>Goodreads</i> platform is mainly an English-speaking one. Thus, 22.2% of users have information in English in their profiles with the aim
         of increasing their impact within the platform. In addition, 16.2% also publish their feedback in English. 
      </p>
      <h2>Reads on the platform</h2>
      <p>The first influencers to be registered on <i>Goodreads</i> did so in 2008, the last ones arriving at the platform precisely in 2017 itself (R=9). On average, its users have 4 years
         of experience on the platform (M=4). Once again, central tendency measures coincide: the median is 4 too (m<sub id="s-acbee13dde08">e</sub>=4) and the most repeated value reaches 4. A standard deviation of 1.744 (σ=1.744) and a variance of 3.043 (σ<sup id="s-ac02086104ee">2</sup>=3.043) were found. Given that <i>Goodreads</i> is 12 years old and that these users were the most relevant ones in 2017, they could be categorised as relatively experienced
         users. In addition to this, many of the existing <i>Goodreads</i> influencers were already known users, as they administered literary blogs. A significant difference appeared between the
         average age of influencers who own a literary blog (35 years old) and those who do not (29 years old). 
      </p>
      <p>Once the general data of the users have been extracted, the time comes to analyse their activity within the platform since
         their registration. From this perspective, a high data dispersion level was found in certain variables because, as seen above,
         the range corresponding to the variable ‘times on the platform’ is very wide. 
      </p>
      <p>On average, the most important Spanish influencers in 2017 followed the updates of 29 authors and bookmarked 9 authors (note
         that 43.6% do not bookmark any writers; Table 2). In this regard, it is worth highlighting the number of works marked as read
         on the platform: there are users with 4 to 2185 readings. All this results in a mean of 575 works enjoyed (σ=414.2). Furthermore,
         95% of users have already planned their upcoming readings and share them on the platform: on average, they have a list of
         368 works (σ=550.43) to read in the near future. The high standard deviation shows the great heterogeneity in the number of
         upcoming readings. Finally, they share the list of books that they have abandoned for various reasons: this time 73.3% of
         users leave that box blank, and the others, on average, claim to have abandoned 11 works (σ=13.21). In short, they are readers
         of a large number of literary works: for illustrative purposes, it can be said that, on average, they have read 334555 pages
         (DT=278670).

      <h2>Activity and ratings on the platform</h2>
      <p>This reading habit results in comments and ratings on the platform. Being the most popular commentators on the platform in
         2017 requires a high level of activity, thus ensuring that numerous readers actively follow their contributions. In this respect,
         these users have a mean above 557 ratings for different works (this means 96.64% of all the works they have read or abandoned;
         Table 3). However, there is a large dispersion of data: they have at least 133 ratings, and 2179 in the case of the most active
         users. This leads to a broad range (R=2046) and a high standard deviation (σ=408.711) and variance (σ<sup id="s-06b9fccade2d">2</sup>=166228). Because some influencers were active for a few months while others stayed on it for several years, a statistically
         significant correlation exists between the number of ratings and the times on the platform (r<sub id="s-b9c4e619968a">p</sub>=0.322, p&lt;0.001). The ratings and the number of votes received in order to become the most important commentators in the community
         similarly correlate (r<sub id="subscript-2">p</sub>=0.397, p&lt;0.000).

      <p>As for the rating given by influencers to their readings (1 to 5 stars), results with low dispersion were found (Figure 2
         ): the mean and the median is 3.7 with a relatively low standard deviation (σ=0.306) and variance (σ<sup id="superscript-2">2</sup>=0.094). Therefore, results follow a normal distribution. These users are arguably competent readers because of their extensive
         intertextual knowledge. Is there any difference between the ratings awarded by influencers and those provided by other readers?
         The most experienced users tend to be more demanding when rating their readings: a difference of 0.23 appears in the mean
         of ratings awarded by the community and influencers (σ=0.283). 
      </p>
      <p>In this regard, a statistically significant negative correlation exists between the number of books read and the average rating
         awarded to their readings (r<sub id="subscript-3">p</sub>=-0.326, p&lt;0.001). That is to say, as the number of works read increases, the rating of their new readings decreases: i.e.
         they become more demanding. Thus, the users with the lowest average rating for their readings are those who have more followers
         (r<sub id="subscript-4">p</sub>=-0.673, p&lt;0.001). This is particularly relevant since it shows that, if the reading intertext of influencers increases, so
         does their level of exigence and, accordingly, the number of followers.

      <h2>Proposed reading canon </h2>
      <p>Sometimes users justify, qualify or complement their rating of works through reviews. Thus, 53.22% of ratings are followed
         by some kind of comment. However, comments more frequently refer to lower ratings, seeking to question their score. 
      </p>
      <p>Finally, their activity related to reading and writing is not confined to reading cataloguing. In fact, they produce different
         contents: a large number of influencers administer a literary blog (35.7%) or a thematic website (56%) exclusively focused
         on their passion: reading. In this regard, it is worth highlighting that 10.2% of the most influential <i>Goodreads</i> users are also content producers on <i>YouTube</i> and belong to the platform of video bloggers who are passionate about reading —known as <i>Booktubers</i>. To conclude, 10.2% of the users analysed, as well as reviewers, assessors or commentators, have authored works published
         in the traditional way. 
      </p>
      <p>Finally, an approximation was made of the canon proposed by these users (Table 4). We firstly extracted the list of the most
         famous authors most often referenced by the main reading influencers in Spain, for which purpose the already read works were
         taken into account (N=52566) —and the ‘future readings’ discarded. In this sense, the most highly rated author (number of
         votes) was Suzanne Collins —read and assessed by 53 of the 100 influencers under study— followed by Jane Austen (49 ratings),
         J.K. Rowling (46) and Rainbow Rowel (45). Most importantly, they are all internationally renowned authors and bestsellers.
         From this perspective, only one Spanish writer — Carlos Ruiz Zafón— appeared on the top 10. 
      </p>
      <p>In terms of average rating, these readers’ ratings are slightly lower than those provided by other <i>Goodreads</i> users. A certain degree of disparity arises between the general assessment of <i>Goodreads</i> users and influencers in relation to authors such as John Green (44 tenths below), Stephenie Meyer (45 tenths) and Dan Brown
         (48 tenths).

      <p>As shown in the table above, a higher number of ratings does not necessarily ensure a higher score. Hence our decision to
         extract a list of authors with at least one five-star work according to the users analysed (Table 5). In this sense, J.K.
         Rowling stands out as the author with the greatest number of influencers rating some of her works as perfect. Authors such
         as Suzanne Collins and Jane Austen are not only the most widely read, but also the best valued. This list includes fewer known
         authors than the previous table. And once again, there is only one Spanish writer: Anna Casanovas. 
      </p>
      <p>In general, despite being the favourite authors of influencers, the latter give them a slightly lower rating than the other
         users. In particular, it is worth noting that Charlotte Brontë receives much better evaluations from influencers than from
         the other users (with a difference of 46 tenths).

      <p>After extracting the list of most read and best rated authors, the most read and best valued works by the top reading influencers
         in Spain were analysed. On this occasion, the first book of the homonymous saga, <i>The Hunger Games</i>, is the most read work among these users: more than half have read it. Almost every work and every author are contemporary,
         however, they emphasize works like <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by Jane Austen, published in 1813, and Charlotte Brontë’s <i>Jane Eyre,</i> published in 1847. On the other hand, not surprisingly, <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> ranks third among the most read works. It deserves to be highlighted that it has an average score of 2.89 stars out of five
         and a difference of 66 tenths below the opinion of other readers of <i>Goodreads</i>.

      <p>Finally, a list of works with the highest number of ‘excellent’ ratings on the platform was extracted. In this case, the work
         with the highest number of maximum scores —29 five-star ratings from different influencers— is the third part of the Harry
         Potter saga (<i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>). Overall, as stressed above, J. K. Rowling is the best valued author in the community. 
      </p>
      <h1> DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</h1>
      <p>As shown by the results of this work, Spanish reading influencers share a number of general characteristics: most of these
         users reside in 4 autonomous regions (Catalonia; the Autonomous Region of Madrid; Andalusia; and the Autonomous Region of
         Valencia). Our findings prove that the platform is mainly female: 79.5% of influencers, which largely coincides with the results
         of <a href="#" id="bib29">Thelwall and Kousha (2016)</a>, who analysed 50000 random users (76% of whom were girls). 
      </p>
      <p>Regarding the age of these users, it is noteworthy that central tendency measures stand at around 33 years old. These results
         largely exceed those of the study carried out by <a href="#" id="bib26">Pérez and López (2015)</a>, who conclude that <i>Booktubers</i> (reading influencers on <i>YouTube</i>) are between 15 and 25 years old. It should be highlighted that only 10% of <i>Goodreads</i> influencers are <i>booktubers</i> too. In short, it can be inferred that both the relevant users and their followers are young women, which matches the profile
         of citizens with the highest percentage of leisure-time book-reading in Spain (FGEE, <a href="#" id="bib6">2018</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>As stated in this work, and in tune with the conclusions of other studies too, they are users with some experience in the
         community and a strong reading habit (<a href="#" id="bib19">Lluch, 2017</a>). Therefore, both their reputation and their influence stem from their reading experience and their several-year-long history
         on social networks during which they have always maintained a constant and active participation. All this allows them to be
         considered expert readers. Rather than analysing literary texts, their reviews rely on influencers’ personal experience. From
         this perspective, many influencers were already doing this before <i>Goodreads</i> even appeared and became popular, since they were former blog administrators. This proves what academicians like <a href="#" id="bib27">Rovira-Collado (2015)</a> suggest: <i>Goodreads</i> is a natural evolution and extension of literary blogs. 
      </p>
      <p>Finally, one of the concerns related to influencers in general, and to reading influencers in particular, is whether they
         post negative reviews or just share their positive opinions. According to the data collected, these readers are more demanding
         than other users and rate with lower scores, even on the best-rated works. No outliers were found in the exploratory study
         that could prove this thesis. Furthermore, they are readers whose evolution over time makes them become more demanding. It
         follows from the above that they try to be objective in their ratings according both to their intertext, interests and reading
         and to their literary competence in general. 
      </p>
      <p>In addition, these users read a large number of different authors, themes and genres. As for the reading canon that they suggest,
         the most referenced and best-rated authors are not necessarily the same, most of them being international contemporary writers
         of bestsellers in Young Adult Literature or crossover, particularly of literary sagas. Important communities of readers have
         been created around these works: e.g. <i>Potterheads</i> and <i>Divergents</i>, to quote but two. However, they also agree on the recommendation of lesser-known authors such as Carlos Ruiz Zafón and Anna
         Casanovas. They propose a canon similar to that of <i>Booktubers</i> according to <a href="#" id="bib13">Hughes (2017)</a> findings. Their proposed canon is constantly updated as well. For example, authors such as Collen Hoover self-published their
         debut novel, <i>Slammed</i>, in January 2012. And works like <i>The Voice by Archer</i> (Mia Sheridan) or <i>A Court of Mist and Fury</i> (Sarah J. Maas) were published in 2016. We also find works belonging to the classical canon such as <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (Jane Austen) and <i>Jane Eyre</i> (Charlotte Brontë), though. 
      </p>
      <p>The most popular and favourite authors of influencers are different from those obtained by the Spanish reading barometer in
         the 2017 and 2018 reports (FGEE, <a href="#" id="bib6">2018</a>; <a href="#" id="bib7">2019</a>). While our study identifies international authors of Children and Youth Literature, the barometer shows a greater presence
         of Spanish writers with a more adult audience, including Ildefonso Falcones, Miguel de Cervantes or Gabriel García Márquez.
         The same holds true in relation to the most read and purchased works. 
      </p>
      <p>These young adults obtain their comments, reviews or ratings in order to react to other users. Their contributions are read
         by thousands of people who closely follow their steps. However, staying among the top 100 influencers is a very demanding
         task. If the activity did not remain current and they stopped participating for a few weeks or a few months, they would simply
         disappear from that select list. This allows the <i>Goodreaders</i> promoted by the platform to be fully active users and to stay up to date at all times. 
      </p>
      <p>All the above inevitably affects the proposed canon: it is very difficult to survive on the list of main influencers over
         time. The pace at which users disappear and new ones appear with different ideas makes the existence of an unchanged reading
         canon impossible. Nonetheless, books actually exist which do not respond to ephemeral interests. 
      </p>
      <p>The results of this study permit to conclude that these are trusted consumer motivators as well as reading motivators: allies
         of formal education and also of reading and literary training. Rather than experts in literature who analyse the quality of
         texts (as a literary critic in the traditional sense), they are common users with a great deal of intertextual knowledge,
         a long trajectory in the community and a broad literary background who share their personal and subjective reading experience
         with other users. This aspect becomes essential for everyone involved in the promotion of reading: schools, libraries, public
         offices, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>To conclude, it is worth pointing out that the main limitation of this study lies in the fact that only the most important
         users belonging to a specific community of readers in a specific country were analysed. However, this work opens up new research
         lines that can be further explored in the future.
