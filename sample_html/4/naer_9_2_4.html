      <h1> INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p> Globalisation, supported by the accelerated increase of innovations and technologies, has created complex scenarios worldwide
         modifying the way citizens cultivate their collective relationships in fundamental aspects such as culture, politics, ideologies
         and the environment. The economic gap generated by this process has concentrated wealth in a few hands, so that the majority
         of the population is now marginalised in their access to resources and opportunities for improvement (<a href="#" id="bib29">Montgomery &amp; Fernández-Cárdenas, 2018</a>). That results in challenges, especially for developing countries trying to fight disparity. Studies from developed countries
         have proven a relationship between expenditure in scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical education (STEM)
         and economic growth (<a href="#" id="bib20">Hanushek &amp; Woessmann, 2015</a>). Thus, a strong relationship seemingly exists between educational quality and economic development (<a href="#" id="bib1">Asmolov, 2013</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>In the case of Ecuador, as a developing country, some social and economic problems related to the lack of scientific and technological
         education make the country vulnerable in its efforts to sustain an economy which is not dependent on oil exports and other
         commodities. Moreover, international and national educational assessments for Ecuador do not show any encouraging results.
         In the PISA assessments, only 16% of 15- year-olds in Ecuador reached PISA proficiency level 2 in reading scores, 43% did
         so in science, and 29% in mathematics (<a href="#" id="bib22">INEVAL, 2018a</a>). These scores are particularly low among girls and underprivileged students in the <i>Ser Bachiller</i> test, a national exam that students should take for graduating at high school. The percentages of students scoring low in
         this test were situated at 35% in mathematics and 22.8% in science. Most students were placed in the elemental scoring —between
         7 and 7.99 out of 10 (<a href="#" id="bib23">INEVAL, 2018b</a>). In sum, these results highlight how hard social and economic mobility is for marginalised individuals within world economies.
      </p>
      <p>This reality is not unknown to policy makers, entrepreneurs and the educational community. Joint efforts have been made to
         counter these results under the new STEM education paradigm. Ecuadorean schools are trying to develop ways to implement STEM
         education in their curricula, probably without fully understanding it. Far from being a content-based learning, STEM education
         is an integrated curricular approach (<a href="#" id="bib25">Kelley &amp; Knowles, 2016</a>) which could foster the development of abilities and lifelong learning skills (<a href="#" id="bib30">Pickering, Yuen, &amp; Wang, 2016</a>). In that sense, it seems suitable for schools to consider three theories that influence the STEM education model: (1) the
         sociocultural paradigm; (2) dialogism; and (3) social innovation. Next, we describe the relationship of each paradigm as a
         foundation for STEM education. 
      </p>
      <p>Firstly, the sociocultural studies of mind theory, led by Lev Vygotsky, sees cognitive development as being the result of
         the appropriation of cultural tools afforded by the social interaction of individuals with society and their own experiences
         (<a href="#" id="bib12">Fernández, Wegerif, Mercer, &amp; Rojas-Drummond, 2015</a>). This paradigm describes sociocultural learning with three elements —a) the influence of the cultural environment; b) semiotic
         mediation; and c) the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)— as elements that influence this process. The combination of various
         levels in the social context to which an individual is exposed becomes necessary to apply a STEM model, insofar as taking
         these aspects into consideration allows us to device a conscious instructional design able to support a relevant educational
         process. 
      </p>
      <p> Secondly, one of the interpretive aspects when it comes to applying the sociocultural paradigm is the use of dialogue, as
         informed by Mikhail Bakhtin’s Russian school of through his studies on semiotics and novelisation (<a href="#" id="bib2">Bakhtin, 1981</a>; <a href="#" id="bib3">Bakhtin, 1984</a>; <a href="#" id="bib4">Bakhtin, 2010</a>). The link between STEM education and dialogism can be identified by utilising four elements of Bakhtin’s theory — sequentiality;
         positioning; plurality; and historicity— to build scientific knowledge (<a href="#" id="bib13">Fernández-Cárdenas, 2014</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, in the Latin American context, Paulo Freire analysed dialogue as the key element for a liberating and transformative
         education based on participants’ action and reflection as a catalyst for aiming a better quality of life without oppression
         (<a href="#" id="bib15">Freire, 2000</a>; <a href="#" id="bib16">Freire, 2008</a>). Exactly like in the sociocultural paradigm, we see the openness to use dialogue as a semiotic mediation that seeks understanding
         and helps construct knowledge, by which we mean moving away from an oppressive education, making sure that the space in which
         education is managed is open to criticism. 
      </p>
      <p> Freire’s detractors accuse him of having failed to address the ways in which oppression intertwines with ethnicity, class
         or sexual orientation (<a href="#" id="bib33">Roberts, 2015</a>). However, dialogue also allows reflection (<a href="#" id="bib36">Sedova, 2017</a>). Reflection in this dialogic process can lead to reduce inequities regarding a variety of ethnicity issues. That is how
         dialogue in STEM education could also create awareness and empower individuals. 
      </p>
      <p> The third theory is the one which presents the capabilities approach as part of social innovation. <a href="#" id="bib37">Sen (1985)</a> proposes through its capabilities approach to assess individual wellbeing beyond the volume of resources a person owns, additionally
         taking into account the ability to function and the freedom to choose how to live. In other words, we can see how the measurement
         of human well-being expands beyond national economic production factors. Under this approach, human beings’ abilities are
         considered opportunities to choose and develop one kind of life or another (<a href="#" id="bib8">Carvajal-Muñoz, 2014</a>; <a href="#" id="bib9">Castillo, 2016</a>). Thus, from the perspective of social justice, STEM education must be inclusive, democratic and relevant. 
      </p>
      <p> STEM education’s combination of sociocultural theory, dialogism and the capabilities approach translates into a transformative
         type of learning. It develops a critical consciousness that promotes a meaningful creation of the world relevant to the participants
         (<a href="#" id="bib7">Britz, Hoffmann, Ponelis, Zimmer, &amp; Lor, 2013</a>; <a href="#" id="bib14">Fernández-Limón, Fernández-Cárdenas, &amp; Galindo, 2018</a>; <a href="#" id="bib32">Reynaga-Peña et al., 2018</a>). Moreover, this approach to learning works as a mechanism to reduce marginality, so that communities can benefit both financially
         and socially, thus managing their quantification of well-being and quality of life based on alternative methods such as the
         capability approach (<a href="#" id="bib38">Sherman, 2016</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>Educational institutions usually have the responsibility for training, preparing and educating students in the broadest sense,
         i.e. providing them with the tools needed for the ever-changing situations of society and companies (<a href="#" id="bib39">Sierra-Gómez, 2013</a>). The current competences required for the 21st century have generated changes in the current educational systems. However,
         the model of some schools is still obsolete and the figure of teachers as transmitters of knowledge must be re-evaluated for
         them to become a learning facilitator (<a href="#" id="bib17">Gisbert, González, &amp; Esteves, 2016</a>; <a href="#" id="bib26">Khan, 2017</a>), in accordance with constructivist theories. 
      </p>
      <p>Considering the previous background, it thus becomes relevant to investigate what is happening in STEM classrooms. Consequently,
         this study set itself the goal of analysing the relationship between dialogism and STEM education through the following research
         question: How could a dialogic and transformative approach to STEM education in the New Harvest School (NHS) strengthen their?
         teaching process? 
      </p>
      <h1> METHOD</h1>
      <p>Our twofold proposal in this paper is: (1) to explore how the change of educational paradigm could be faced by the STEM teachers
         at NHS through dialogic and transformative learning; and (2) to identify the current profile of STEM teachers, so that the
         administrative team can take it into consideration as part of their teaching professional development. 
      </p>
      <h2>Methodological approach</h2>
      <p>This study was conducted with the support of a critical qualitative methodology that used ethnographic tools (<a href="#" id="bib19">Green &amp; Bloome, 2004</a>; <a href="#" id="bib18">Green, Castanheira, Skukauskaite, &amp; Hammond, 2015</a>; <a href="#" id="bib6">Bloome &amp; Green, 2015</a>). This allowed the development of “emerging and convergent designs that are structured during the search process” (Cifuentes-Gil, <a href="#" id="bib10">2011</a>, p.15) emphasising social relationships over the numerical and predictive character of quantitative research studies (<a href="#" id="bib11">Creswell, 2012</a>; <a href="#" id="bib35">Sampieri &amp; Torres, 2018</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>The critical social approach aligned with the qualitative methodology so that findings could be built through a collective
         process based on discursive and community argumentation, where the proposal consisted in generating processes of reflection,
         empowerment and transformation (<a href="#" id="bib10">Cifuentes-Gil, 2011</a>). Additionally, the participation was registered with the aim of “collecting information specifically to guide the future”
         (Quintero,<a href="#" id="bib31">2017</a>, p. 57) by means of dialogic tools. This process involved looking, thinking and acting, which was repeated when the students
         reflected on their processes (<a href="#" id="bib41">Stringer, 2007</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>To apply the methodological approach described above, we recognised the importance of a researcher’s ethical code and alignment
         with ethical research concepts (<a href="#" id="bib40">Sobočan, Bertotti, &amp; Strom-Gottfried, 2019</a>; <a href="#" id="bib42">Valenzuela-González &amp; Flores-Fahara, 2014</a>). Intellectual honesty, informed consent and transferability were achieved through forms of consent, names of participants
         remained anonymous, and proper reference to previous works was carried out. 
      </p>
      <h2>Participants</h2>
      <p>The study developed from August to November 2018 at NHS —an educational institution located in Guayaquil, Ecuador. NHS provides
         educational services both in the morning and in the afternoon. The cost of tuition for morning shift parents is higher than
         for the afternoon shift ones, who have fewer economic resources. 
      </p>
      <p> Four high school teachers named A, B, C, and D were selected to participate in this study because of their proximity to students
         who find themselves in the process of transition towards the university, as a result of which those teachers’ work strongly
         affects their students’ decision to choose STEM careers. Table 1 presents relevant characteristics of the participants in
         this study.

      <p>Teachers A and B were teachers with no previous dialogic teaching experience, while teachers C and D had indirect experiences
         because they had received International Baccalaureate training which revolves around 3 key elements ——‘Theory of Knowledge’;
         ‘Extended Essay’; and ‘Creativity, activity and service’— that call for critical, emotional and process reflection (<a href="#" id="bib24">International Baccalaurate, 2020</a>). 
      </p>
      <p> Additionally, the academic vice-chancellor and the administrator of the institution were interviewed about academic planning,
         teacher training and the infrastructure to support STEM Education. They both have worked at NHS for 12 years incorporating
         institutional educational plans as well as national changes into the curriculum.

      <p>The semi-structured interviews for teachers had open-ended questions divided into three sections: professional experience;
         dialogic elements in their classes; and transcripts. In turn, the semi-structured interview with the academic vice-chancellor
         contained open-ended questions divided into two sections: professional experience; and dialogic elements in the school. Finally,
         a semi-structured interview with the administrator included a section for: her professional experience; up-to-date achievements
         of the school; and areas of exploration for the future. 
      </p>
      <h2>Procedures to obtain information</h2>
      <p>First, the classes observed were chosen through a mutual availability agreement, so that each teacher was expected to present
         the best version of their teaching style. After the four observations, transcripts were made based on which we proceeded to
         meet each teacher to reflect on the lesson process and to compare perspectives reshaping fieldnotes and obtaining information
         with semi-structured interviews. 
      </p>
      <p> The semi-structured interviews with the academic vice-principal and the administrator of the institution were conducted through
         separate appointments. 
      </p>
      <h2>Data analysis strategy </h2>
      <p>The communication competence approach (<a href="#" id="bib21">Hymes, 2005</a>) served to categorise the transcripts into communicative situations, events and acts (see also Rojas-Drummond, Mazón, Fernández-Cárdenas
         &amp; Wegerif, <a href="#" id="bib34">2006</a>). A review of the transcripts was carried out to verify the presence or absence of the four features characterising dialogism,
         identifying examples where they occurred. The data were classified according to analytic domains, as well as classifying the
         themes that emerged from participants. 
      </p>
      <p> To confirm the reliability of class observation, teachers were asked about their perceptions of the transcripts where they
         had been involved, so that they could confirm instances of sequentiality, positioning, plurality and historicity. It also
         helped to review the field notes taken throughout the observations. The additional data from the four teachers’ interviews
         —and those with the academic vice-chancellor, as well as with the administrative staff— were analysed creating codes to classify
         the themes that emerged around their STEM teacher profile.

      <h2> Context of lessons</h2>
      <p>Table 3 lists 8 variables that describe the context in which the four lessons were given. The most relevant findings about
         this table were: (1) afternoon classes used the national curriculum while morning class students received the International
         Baccalaureate Organisation Diploma Programme; and (2) professor A and B’s class themes required the use of mathematical operations
         while those of professor C and D did not.

      <h2>Communication Ethnography</h2>
      <p>Three types of communicative events were recognised in all four lessons: Initial moment; development moment; and closing moment.
         These communicative events are linked to the school methodology for developing critical thinking through lesson teaching and
         structure. 
      </p>
      <p> Tables 4 and 5 provide examples of the communication ethnographic structure for teacher B and teacher D. The initial moment
         had an “activation of previous knowledge” in both, but they differ on how they did it. In the case of teacher B, the activation
         emphasis was placed on conceptual definitions of the students’ previous knowledge, while teacher D’s class presented a question
         that emphasised the opinion and individual experience of students. The same difference appeared in the next type of communicative
         event, corresponding to the development moment. Teacher B attempted to promote students’ levels of remembering and understanding,
         according to Bloom’s taxonomy (1984), whereas teacher D’s lesson focused on the analysing and evaluating levels.

      <h2>Dialogism in lessons</h2>
      <p>It was found that the construction of academic knowledge in the four lessons —the same as in all spheres of human activity—
         required dialogue, in this case between teachers and students. The results of observing these four lessons showed the relevance
         of Bakhtin’s theoretical elements (sequentiality, positioning, plurality and historicity) to build scientific knowledge. Some
         examples for each of them are offered below. 
      </p>
      <h3>Sequentiality</h3>
      <p>A total of 174, 152, 96 and 156 turns, respectively, were exchanged in the lessons taught by teachers A, B, C and D. Table
         6 shows that the percentages corresponding to teachers’ and students’ turns were roughly the same. However, class D students
         participated to a greater extent despite the fact that this class had the smallest number of students.

         the issue of permutations with the practical case of changing positions. Sequentiality was verified when any student was able
         to express their desire to return to their original sitting position. Teacher A gave his consent in turn 11, and the other
         students, despite saying nothing, gave their consent by moving to their original sitting positions too. Interestingly, the
         teacher formally named this exercise as a ‘permutation’ in turn 12.

      <p> Sequentiality was also supported using gestures. Figure 2 presents sequentiality through the search of agreements and including
         the use of gestural components. Teacher B used the eraser to point at what he wanted to erase by making the corresponding
         gesture. The students’ response determined his next action, which was erasing the whiteboard and projecting new exercises
         from the computer, in turn 35.

      <p> Sequentiality was presented in different stages of communicative events using words that urged participants to become involved
         in dialogue. Table 7 collected words such as “what, how and why” that prompted participants to reflect upon the topic discussed
         and, in that way, accomplished the objective(s) of each lesson.

      <p> The use of those words to express sequentiality was portrayed in teacher C’s lesson through the presentation of a video about
         the experiment carried out by Meselson and Stahl, after which she asked students questions about it. During that process,
         sequentiality was identified mainly by means of these words; for example, “what” was used 52 times, which prompted the recognition
         both of the self and of the other. In Figure 3 excerpt, teacher C’s utilisation of these questions along with students’ own
         reflection led themselves to set the purpose of this experiment, as in turn 7, when she asked <i>“...What were they dealing with? What else were they looking for?”</i>. The students used terms such as prove, check, observe and combine, and in turn 12 teacher C reaffirmed the answers given
         by the students saying in her intervention “<i>We have that scientists wanted to check, observe, compare…” </i>By doing this,<i></i>she recognised the different points of view and built up her next question based on them, when in the same turn she said,
         <i>“So, what would be the conclusion”.</i></p>

      <h3>Positioning</h3>
      <p>Dialogism gives the opportunity for the actors taking part in the dialogic act to construct their own position with respect
         to others. This positioning was influenced by the construction of one’s own posture and the contribution of knowledge made
         by the other parties. Table 8 shows the positioning by classifying the turns according to one of the six levels of thinking
         developed by Bloom (<a href="#" id="bib5">1984</a> ; see also Wei &amp; Ou, <a href="#" id="bib43">2019</a>). Most positionings were identified in lessons A, B and C, which focused more strongly on the remembering and understanding
         levels of thinking. In contrast, most of the positionings in lesson D emphasised the analysis and evaluation levels of thinking.

      <p>The positioning was described through the participation of students and the teacher with regard to the thinking levels of
         Bloom’s taxonomy. For instance, Figure 4 portrays the conversation in Teachers D’s class about children as an economic asset
         in Ecuador. This particular conversation was built upon the participants’ beliefs about the economic reasons for a 10-year-old
         kid in an agricultural society to work, while other children might be studying elsewhere. In turn 53, the teacher opened the
         possibility to discuss the issue of gender role in agricultural societies, with the question <i>“...how good is it to have a boy or a girl?</i>,<i>”</i> so that students were able to take a position. In turn 57, one student argued that there was sexism in the way roles were
         divided and voiced out that this was an area to work on, by saying <i>“...because there are many things that women and men can do...”</i> However, he recognised that there might be a difference between the beliefs of people from rural and urban areas.

      <p> Figure 5 portrays one conversation in Teacher B’s class which focused on strengthening the topic of metal hydrides through
         exercises on the board. In that lesson, as in class A and C, the interaction relied only on Bloom’s level of recognition (<a href="#" id="bib5">1984</a>); and therefore, dialogue did not work for the purpose of analysing, evaluating or creating —in contrast to class D. The
         positioning construction was led by the teacher, who posed questions that required the students’ previous knowledge to support
         their dialogic position. In turn 106, the teacher made student 13 see how the solution to that exercise was actually not possible,
         because <i>“you can realise that, in this case, it is poorly formulated”</i>; this meant that he did not have to focus on solving it. However, in turn 110, the students laughed at student 13 because
         he was surprised to check that the exercise had such characteristics. It is worth highlighting that not all events required
         higher levels of cognition, and thus, elaborate positionings. However, we would suggest that this event was productive in
         highlighting the need for clearly formulated problems in order to make a solution possible.

      <h3>Plurality</h3>
      <p>The plurality of voices can be recognised in the participation of other voices when building dialogue. Figure 6 represents
         plurality in class D. In this communicative act, the voices of the teacher and the students were related to the topic of taking
         care of old people. In turn 33, a student mentioned that <i>“</i><i>it is the tradition to take care of elders because they took care of </i><i>us</i>.” There was a contrasting voice in turn 37 where Student 1 expressed <i>“but in the United States, or in northern countries, they have the culture of turning 18 and </i><i>go leave alone</i><i>”.</i> The same topic gave the opportunity to create the expectation about their future(s) as well as to hear their voices. In turn
         38, the teacher asked the students<i> “Would you take care of your parents even when they are old and you have your own families?”</i> In turn 39, a student answered,<i> “I have to give my parents what they gave me.”</i></p>
      <figure><img src="fig_6.png" alt=""/><figcaption><strong>Figure 6. </strong><b></b>Excerpt First Example of Plurality in teacher D’s lesson 
         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p></p>
      <p>Note at this point that the voice of culture had its own position in dialogue. It seemed to shape the participants’ beliefs,
         actions and identity (<a href="#" id="bib2">Bakhtin, 1981</a>; <a href="#" id="bib27">Kumpulainen &amp; Rajala, 2017</a>). 
      </p>
      <p> Figure 7 presents class D, where voice plurality was shown using a more personal conversation approach to the topic that
         even caused laughter. The topic was not presented as formally as in the other classes. The previous topic that they were discussing
         was related to the number of children who could be raised? in different countries; therefore, in turns 96 to 107, students’
         voices were recognised because the conversation changed directions when one student asked the teacher<i>“…will you have a child?</i>.<i>”</i> This became a breaking point, since the teacher not only answered “<i>this year maybe”</i>, but continued giving the opportunity for other students to ask more questions about it and even to make jokes with questions
         like<i> “for Christmas?</i>.<i>”</i> Dialogue implies that building a consensus is not necessary, but it could prove collectively useful to express a variety
         of positions as an aesthetic exercise providing valuable insights (<a href="#" id="bib13">Fernández-Cárdenas, 2014</a>; <a href="#" id="bib27">Kumpulainen &amp; Rajala, 2017</a>). Moreover, the teacher used this event to inform students about the different options linked to the topic of planning a
         family. Thus, in turn 109, he introduced the concept of contraceptives and family counselling.

      </figure>
      <p>The examples of the other classes lacked clear elements reflecting plurality. This probably had to do with the focus of classes
         on lower cognitive performance levels. In other words, lessons with a more procedural functioning provided a more basic argumentation
         where the requirement of plurality was not a component needed to have a productive interaction in those communicative events.
         On the opposite side, in lessons dealing with more controversial issues, such as lesson D, the topic itself and the way in
         which the teacher handled the class gave more opportunities for students’ cognition in order to go beyond the analysing level
         within the taxonomy developed by Bloom taxonomy (1956). That might explain why this class was rich in terms of plurality of
         voices and positionings.

      <h3>Historicity</h3>
      <p>Historicity in dialogism manifests the discipline’s own language, in this case of science,? to build conversations. Table
         9 shows the use of scientific vocabulary and historically-determined disciplinary conversations in each class showing the
         number of times they were used in the lessons. For example, in Mathematics, the use of words such as <i>permutation, factorial </i>and<i> elements</i>; in Chemistry, the names of elements such as <i>cadmium, vanadium </i>or<i> potassium</i>; in Biology<i> caesium, N15 </i>and<i> dense</i>; and in Environmental Systems, the utilisation of <i>resources, overcrowded </i>and<i> mortality</i>. All these words represented the history of a discipline as part of a long conversation between scholars, but also between
         teachers and pupils referring to these words as cultural tools for naming academically phenomena both in the natural and in
         the social sphere (<a href="#" id="bib28">Maybin, 2006</a>; <a href="#" id="bib13">Fernández-Cárdenas, 2014</a>).

      <p>For instance, in relation to the presence of historicity in a Biology class, Figure 8 shows that, seeking to construct knowledge
         in this lesson, the teacher resorted to students’ previous knowledge. In turn 17, the student mentioned the type of bacteria
         as <i>prokaryotes</i>. In turn 19, the student answered the teacher with the name of two isotopes: <i>N15 and N14</i>. In turn 21, a student highlighted that they had seen the periodic table last year. In turn 23, the student referred to<i> electrons</i>, and in turn 25, to the location of neutrons that were <i>in the core</i> of the atoms. All the preceding examples supported the fact that participants remembered terminology specifically associated
         with the subject that they had learnt during the previous years.

      <p> Similarly, in relation to the role of historicity in a Mathematics class, Figure 9 presents the case of teacher A’s lesson,
         where previous vocabulary related to the subject, such as the word <i>“quinela”</i> —a math-based game— was needed in order to construct knowledge. Starting precisely with the numbers which include their symbol
         and assigned meaning, e.g. numbers <i>8</i> and<i> 2 </i>in turn 105, and number <i>12</i> in turn 106. Within the same excerpt, in turn 108, the student recalls <i>“I add them all” —</i>which is historically associated with mathematical procedural knowledge.

      <h2>Teacher profile</h2>
      <p>Teachers’ professional training levels in the school are varied. Out of 119 teachers, only 30% had a teaching career, while
         the other 70% had careers as Biologists, Electrical Engineers, Mechanical Engineers or experts in Business Administration,
         or they were studying. As mentioned above, the four teachers selected did not have a teaching career. Professor C, who is
         also a coordinator of the science area, mentioned that <i>“[in the institution’s science team] Many of us chose teaching for an economic reason in the beginning and then it became
            attractive as a profession. So, little by little we became teachers.”</i></p>
      <p> The knowledge society in the local context is directly influenced by the National Government through the Ministry of Education.
         According to the Vice-Chancellor: “<i>Since the times of President Correa</i><i>,</i><i> the Unified General Baccalaureate system has been implemented as a measure for students to take a unified degree exam. This
            implies </i><i>that all</i><i> students now have taken the same subjects, which also led to reduce the hours of certain subjects so that everyone sees the
            same thing.” </i>This implied that science teachers had the worry about teaching the same content in less hours to prepare the students for
         the “Ser Bachiller test”. 
      </p>
      <p> When teachers were asked about dialogism it was unknown to them. Teacher A replied: <i>“Does it have to do with dialogue? I’m not sure”</i>, while teacher B gave a resonant <i>“No.”</i> In turn, teacher C said <i>“I did not know about dialogue. I could</i><i>say that perhaps I practiced certain things as part of the use of constructivism, but just as I did as dialogism??”</i>. Finally, teacher D explained: <i>“I agree, I didn’t know either. Although there were certain things that helped me to do it thanks to the model of the International
            Baccalaureate, I did not know it nor its scope as a dialogue.”</i></p>
      <p> An analysis of teachers’ pedagogical ideology revealed that their beliefs make them take certain actions which had consequences
         in their pedagogical development with a tendency to a liberating stance. For example, when they were asked about the positive
         aspects of classes, they stressed more active participation of students. 
      </p>
      <h1> DISCUSSION</h1>
      <p> This study investigated how a dialogic and transformative training of baccalaureate teachers at NHS could strengthen their
         STEM teaching process. For this purpose, these teachers’ classes were observed and recorded. In addition, they were interviewed
         at the end of the academic term. Field notes and transcripts from those classes, as well as interviews with teachers were
         analysed in terms of their possible dialogic traits. Similarly, the interviews proved helpful for contrasting the perspective
         of teachers with those of the vice-principal and the school manager. The results obtained from this research suggest that
         traits of dialogism can be found in the observed STEM classes. 
      </p>
      <p> Sequentiality, as part of the dialogic trait, showed that taking turns and shifting between them became an opportunity to
         manifest the recognition of both the “self” and the “other” as stated by <a href="#" id="bib2">Bakhtin (1981)</a>; or expressed differently, that there was a dialogue towards the construction of knowledge. In the cases of classes A, B
         and C, the turns were more or less equally divided between teachers and students, but in class D, students had 64% of turns,
         even though that was the class with fewer students. The previous findings could imply that teacher D gave more opportunities
         for students to have a voice, not only to answer but also to take the role of questioning and inquiring about the topics discussed.
      </p>
      <p> However, the class topic itself might have been another variable that influenced dialogue. In teachers A and B’s classes,
         tension existed between students to take turns through their participation, since it required being in front of their classmates
         to solve exercises on the board. In turn, teachers C and D preferred not to present mathematical calculations; instead, they
         chose to provide open topics, eliciting a more elaborate dialogue where students could see a context and create a sequence.
      </p>
      <p> Another variable affecting sequentiality was the ability to lead students to exemplify what they proposed with meaningful
         life experiences. Despite the fact that the teacher in class A also used examples that illustrated real life experience, they
         did not necessarily connect with the students. For example, teacher A utilised the example of a casino to which students had
         not been, since they were prohibited in Ecuador some years ago. In contrast, teacher D took advantage of participants’ families
         and even his family to build upon the topic. 
      </p>
      <p> Positioning was a feature that described dialogue and provided support in science education because it allowed building points
         of view that could be transformed while developing the dialogue in which other positions were recognised. Teachers had previously
         stated the objectives of their classes based on one of Bloom’s levels of thinking (<a href="#" id="bib5">1984</a>). Whereas Classes A, B and C had more turns in the lower levels of thinking, the dialogue in class D presented more turns
         corresponding to the higher level of thinking; i.e. class D was working on the critical consciousness of individuals, thus
         allowing them to take positions. 
      </p>
      <p> It also became clear that more questions were asked by teachers making students assume the role of suggesting answers. According
         to the scientific method premises, one should be able to ask questions; consequently, it would be beneficial to increase the
         rate of questions posed by students. Therefore, teachers arguably exhibited the Socratic method by using questions aimed at
         encouraging students to reflect and reason the answer through their own effort. However, a more dialogic exercise could have
         involved asking students to formulate the questions as well. 
      </p>
      <p>Plurality was based on the recognition of other voices that may have logic in what they want to convey. Especially in class
         D, students were able to portray plurality in dialogue by recognising their local contexts, as well as opinions and practices
         from elsewhere, such as the United States and India. The teacher’s role consisted in creating an “interactional space for
         students to talk and think together” (<a href="#" id="bib27">Kumpulainen &amp; Rajala, 2017</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>Overall, teachers and students exhibited plurality in the form of freedom to think and talk to each other. That resulted in
         a liberating agenda through education, one in which students can empower themselves (<a href="#" id="bib15">Freire, 2000</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>The use of academic vocabulary associated with the subjects as well as the analysis of fragments permitted to check that there
         was a historicity invoked by the participants. The construction of knowledge went from an everyday concept (something previously
         known to the individual) to one characterised by greater formality (see also Fernández-Limón, Fernández-Cárdenas, &amp; Gómez-Galindo,
         <a href="#" id="bib14">2018</a>). Figure 10 shows that each person has previously acquired (individual or shared) knowledge and a certain level of thinking
         about it. Knowledge can be developed thanks to these dialogic interactions. In this way, the feature of historicity evokes
         such knowledge and previous thinking levels of other individuals build on that new scientific knowledge. 
      </p>
      <figure><img src="fig_10.png" alt=""/><figcaption><strong>Figure 10. </strong><b></b>Knowledge creation spiral 
         </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For instance, communicative act 3 in teacher A’s lesson —<i>“exemplification of the subject of permutations with the exercise of changing positions”</i>— showed how participants go from talking about <i>“changing positions</i>,<i>” “elements,” “order” and “interference of elements ”</i> to talking about <i>“permutations</i>.<i>”</i> This determined the way in which the teacher worked building on students’ previous knowledge in order to introduce the formal
         terminology of <i>“permutations”</i> and <i>“factorial”</i> at the end of this communicative act. 
      </p>
      <p> During the class observation process, teachers and students used gestural components to convey their position and prompted
         different turn sequences based on previous answers. The case of the teacher who made the gesture of erasing the board, or
         when he had to choose the student by pointing at him also became a dialogic element that strengthened communication. 
      </p>
      <p> The teachers’ meta-conscious process guided the construction of knowledge for their classes as highlighted above. Even though
         they did not take teaching as a career, the dialogic position seemed to guarantee a construction of knowledge that allowed
         students to empower themselves. Teachers’ knowledge building seemed to be affected by the type of curriculum. Teachers A and
         B were teaching the national curriculum, which focused on content, while teachers C and D were teaching the International
         Baccalaureate Program —centred on the core of emotional processes and knowledge reflection. This was also related to the economic
         differences regarding tuition between morning and afternoon shifts. 
      </p>
      <p> This research itself became a dialogic tool for presenting a dialogical education as a way to start innovative processes
         in the school. The interviews triggered a reflection process for the teachers, the vice principal and the school managers.
      </p>
      <h1> CONCLUSIONS</h1>
      <p>The aim of this research was to evaluate the ways in which the dialogic and transformative practices of high school teachers
         could strengthen STEM teaching approaches. It has been shown that the main benefit might lie in the fact that such as approach
         can provide opportunities to empower teachers and students’ participation. 
      </p>
      <p> The doors to dialogue reshape the perception about the figure of the teacher’s authority. This helps to build trust and create
         a suitable environment to promote learning centred on students and on supporting their development. Thus, it is important
         to build up a dialogic conversation between the institution and all the stakeholders related to it following <a href="#" id="bib36">Sedova (2017)</a>, according to whom dialogue is a dynamic and non-linear process. 
      </p>
      <p> This research managed to awaken a dialogue for the construction of scientific and technological knowledge between the teachers
         and authorities of the school where this study took place. The experience of creating the space to think together about the
         improvement of their learning experience brought out the intentions both of the participants and of the researcher to raise
         the educational quality of this institution. 
      </p>
      <p>As a result, dialogic training was proposed as a part of the innovations to strengthen the STEM teaching process for the students
         of this educational institution. A recommendation was made for the training sessions to be planned not only for the months
         during which the students do not attend school. Instead, they could be carried out throughout the year to follow up the processes
         transversely, revolving around dialogism to create a conversation where sequentiality, positioning, plurality and historicity
         are illustrated and discussed. 
      </p>
      <p>Limitations include the applicability of our findings to other contexts. Some characteristics of the Ecuadorian magisterium
         were inferred, but the findings only apply to NHS. Another constraint is the number of selected participants who responded
         to this survey, a trade-off for learning deeply about the few cases studied. 
      </p>
      <p> The results obtained for the four characteristics of dialogism have a variety of implications for further research efforts,
         namely: (1) the study of talk turn sequences during interaction; (2) the analysis of positionings; (3) the plurality of voices;
         and (4) the use of historically developed cultural tools and vocabulary in schools that have already set up a curriculum with
         a transversal axis in STEM. These elements could be used to analyse students’ learning experience and to improve knowledge
         construction quality through the freedom they enjoy in such processes. A dialogic agenda can be suggested as a useful strategy
         to follow in the educational settings involved. This would also serve a higher ethical goal of developing more autonomous
         participants in STEM education, which can thus become more inclusive, democratic and relevant.
