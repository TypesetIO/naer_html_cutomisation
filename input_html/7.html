                        data-jats-ref-type="bibr">Dávila &amp; Naya, 2006</a>) laid the groundwork for subsequent international policies, which culminated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in which children became the subject of rights for the first time.</p>
                  <p id="p-ad8d6cd54a57">After having been laboriously drafted for one decade, the Convention was approved by the General Assembly in Resolution 44/25 dated 20 November 1989, and the signing and ratification or adhesion to the Convention was held in New York on 26 January 1990. The Convention entered into force on 2 September 1990 in conformance with the provisions contained in its article 49.</p>
                  <p id="p-dc096ce46319">On 1 October 2015, Somalia ratified the Convention, and since then a total of 196 countries have adhered to this important multilateral commitment to protect the fundamental guarantees of childhood. Therefore, this is the human rights treaty that has been the most widely ratified in history. The United States is the only country that has yet to complete the process. Despite having signed it in 1995, it has not yet ratified the Convention; that is, it supports the rights described in the document but is not legally committed to abide by it.</p>
                  <p id="p-757af2190c62">In order for the rights of children to be meaningful, it is not enough for a state to accept –or even ratify– the Convention on the rights of the Child. They must also put it into practice.</p>
                  <p id="p-452c45e473db">With the intention of keeping watch over the exercise of the rights of the child, in 1991 the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) was established, a body made up of independent experts who oversee implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by the States Parties.</p>
                  <p id="p-8ce42b528bbe">As stated in its regulations, the Committee is headquartered in Geneva. It usually holds three periods of sessions per year. The sessions are comprised of a three-week plenary session. Previous to the period of sessions, a working group meets for one week.</p>
                  <p id="p-6c1f16cfb0d8">Article 4 of the Convention stipulates that states must effectively implement the rights of the child by adopting any measures needed, using up to the maximum resources available to do so. Article 44 requires the States Parties to report to the Committee on the measures they are taking to make the rights of the child a reality. </p>
                  <p id="p-9c76c1962db2">Thus, all the States Parties have to submit periodic reports to the Committee on the way these rights are exercised. Initially, the states have to submit a two-year report after adhering to the Convention, and later they must submit reports every five years. The Committee examines each report and expresses its concerns and recommendations to the States Parties in the guise of Final Observations.</p>
                  <p id="paragraph-9">The reports must mention the measures that the States Parties have adopted to implement the rights listed in the Convention and the progress made in terms of enjoyment of these rights. They should also indicate any circumstances and difficulties, if applicable, that affect the degree of compliance with the main obligations of the Convention. Therefore, the reports must contain enough information for the Committee to gain an overall understanding of the implementation of the Convention in that country.</p>
                  <p id="paragraph-10">The first periodic reports started in 1992. By the 71<sup id="superscript-2">st</sup> session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child held on 29 January 2016, the Committee had received 493 reports in conformance with article 44 of the convention, including 198 initial reports and 295 periodic reports.</p>

The concept of free play is tricky. Play is either free or it is not. In cities, where more and more children on the planet live and will continue to live, freedom and creativity of play cannot be conditioned or –even worse– curtailed for the sake of safety and the increasing tendency for parents to be overprotective  (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="#R111493522305313"

Three hundred and fifty experts in child play participated in the consultation, along with more than 400 children. As stated in the report (IPA,<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="#R111493522305309"

                     <p id="p-1d847b2c6eed">In its introduction, the Committee expresses its concern with the States’ lack of recognition of the rights contained in Article 31. It adds that "poor recognition of their significance in the lives of children results in lack of investment in appropriate provisions, weak or non-existent protective legislation and the invisibility of children in national and local-level planning. In general, where investment is made, it is in the provision of structured and orga-nized activities, but equally important is the need to create time and space for children to engage in spontaneous play, recrea-tion and creativity, and to promote societal attitudes that sup-port and encourage such activity."</p>
                     <p id="p-1a387b89e7aa">The committee expressed its concern with inequality in the enjoyment of the rights cited in Article 31 by girls, poor children, children with disabilities, indigenous children and those belonging to minorities, among others.</p>

In other words, do the States Parties invest more dedication and effort into fostering and defending the child’s right to play? It is essential to ascertain the impact on recognition of the child’s right to play since GO No. 17 has entered into force. How is this right being exercised? Are there reports on the indicators proposed by the Committee? What measures are the States Parties taking to foster child’s play in the family, school and social life?</p>

                  <p id="t-a1ce017fcba7">In order to answer these questions, we first reviewed the reports that the States Parties forwarded to the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), as well as the Final Observations issued by this Committee to the States Parties, in which it tells them its opinion on the supposed advances and achievements cited by the states in their reports.</p>
                  <p id="p-73b43b9584b7">The second phase of the study analyses whether the reports as well as the Final Observations issued since the date on which GO No. 17 was approved contain more references to article 31.</p>

These countries belong to the European Union, or to the OECD if they do not belong to the EU. In this way, the reports issued by the States Parties to the CRC were reviewed, while the CRC’s Final Observations to these same States Parties were also reviewed. The USA was excluded from the sample because, since it is an OECD member but has not ratified the Convention, it is not obligated to draw up reports or receive guidance from the CRC.</p>
                  <p id="p-375a3dfe77e2">In the second part, the sample was comprised of all the countries that have issued a report to the CRC after GO No. 17 entered into force (April 2013) and up to 31 December 2017. The review includes 78 States Parties. The CRC’s Final Observations for the States Parties on the periodic reports they submitted were also reviewed. The revision includes a total of 96 States Parties.</p>
                  <p id="p-3cbec5336994">By reading the reports and Final Observations of the States Parties in the study sample, all the information related to the child’s right to play was collected. To analyse the content of the document sources from a comparative, international perspective, three areas in which child’s play occurs were established: family, school and social. At the same time, for each area, four attributes that define the child’s right to play were established: play time, play space, play materials and playmates or players. </p>
                  <p id="p-1da2a43389f2">We intended to process the document information according to whether the state reported on the structural measures (legal, institutional and regulatory framework) or process (implementation of policies and action programmes) or whether it reported on the results obtained (achievements, level of implementation, exercise or violation of the right in practice). However, in many cases –as we shall see below– the States Parties do not clearly and precisely define the intentions and scope of their policies, thus hindering an evaluation of the recognition of this right  (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="#R111493522305299"

Likewise, in Sweden (1997), the learning objectives stress the importance of play and regard inspiring the children with plenty of time, spaces and materials for their games as an essential job. The report from Sweden (2004) states that preschools have to offer a safe environment, furthermore one also stimulates children to play and be active. It is essential to guarantee the child’s right to put his or her own initiative, imagination and creativity into practice in an atmosphere of play and learning. Along the same lines, in the United Kingdom (2008), the Department of Education implements a programme for children aged 2 which focuses on constructive play in groups in order to develop the child’s social development, improve their communication and language skills and stimulate their imagination through play. Furthermore, the educational system in Northern Ireland recognises that education is more effective when children learn through an enriched experience based on play.</p>

                                 <p id="p-43">There are countries whose governments recognise the importance of play. The United Kingdom (1999) states that high-quality facilities benefit the child’s overall development. In its 2002 report, it mentions that the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA) is in charge of the dissemination, education, training and safety of play. The NPFA has four training headquarters for monitoring: it manages the National Play Information Centre (NPIC), which is the most important centre in the world specialising in child’s play; it has a forum, the Play Safety Forum, whose publication “Playground Safety Guidelines” seeks a balance between risk and safety in play. In Sweden (2004), the report states that children can lose creativity and spontaneity if the forms of entertainment they are offered are organised in advance and are overly supervised and predefined. The report from Ireland (2005) mentions that it is the first country in the world to have a detailed national policy on play (Ready, Steady, Play: A National Play Policy). Spain (2009) indicates that one of the objectives of the Strategic National Childhood Plan is to foster the child’s right to play, leisure and free time by creating appropriate, accessible and safe spaces.</p>

                                 <p id="p-44">With regard to play in public space, there are several state initiatives which have enacted laws and measures taken to guarantee sites meant for children and youths. Thus, in Austria (1997 and 2004), the United Kingdom (1999), Spain (2001), Italy (2002), Germany (2003), Australia (2004), the Netherlands (2018) and Korea (2008), the urban planning regulations include the creation of lands set aside for play and recreation. At the same time, in some cases they also encourage children’s participation in the planning of these spaces. Guaranteeing the safety of playgrounds in Spain (2001), United Kingdom (2002), Canada (2003) and Romania (2008) is also one of the states’ concerns.</p>

                                 <p id="p-45">Some countries, like Canada (1994), are aware that children’s access to free-time facilities is unequal, especially for children who live in remote or rural communities. Belgium (2009) subsidises community programmes that plan play areas and free-time facilities with the goal of updating the dynamic of neighbourhood life and fostering encounters among generations and cultures.</p>

In Austria (2011), too, there are several associations which disseminate and promote play, such as the Game Centre (Spielebox) and the Institute for Free-time Education (Institut für Freizeitpädagogik, IFP). Italy (2010) mentions holding International Play Day on the 28<sup id="s-02d63574eb24">th</sup> of May since 2005, promoted by the National City and Play Association (Associazione nazionale Città in gioco – GioNa).</p>

                                 <p id="p-47">Some countries show an interest in finding out children’s opinions via surveys. The children (Germany, 2003; Ireland, 2005; United Kingdom, 2008; Italy, 2010) respond that they want more play areas and more opportunities for free time and social life. They view play and recreation as important aspects of their quality of life. The report from the Netherlands (2008) mentions that today, youths spend less free time in group activities in a public setting (on the street or on playgrounds) and more on individual activities in private settings.</p>

Croatia (2003) reports that all public libraries now have these rooms.

However, 69.23% of the reports lack a single mention of the child’s right to play. </p>
                     <p id="p-8b90ec2a8575">After subjecting the content of the reports to a qualitative analysis, when referring to the child’s right to play, the States Parties state that:</p>

                           <p id="p-62">They do not pay any attention to this right. In this sense, we can cite the reports from Santa Lucia (2013), Ethiopia (2013) and Honduras (2014). The report from Ethiopia is utterly sincere and states that this is due to the lack of resources, the low level of community participation and the lack of recognition of this need. The Honduran report is also quite clear and openly states the need for national public policies to improve inter-institutional and inter-sector articulation, to be allocated more economic and human resources and to extend to all the communities and children in the country, particularly in rural areas.</p>

However, the report from Vanuatu (2016) expands and further explores this aspect by considering that early childhood care and education call for principles and policy guidelines on recreational equipment and materials. In this way, children can play on adapted facilities and equipment and have the opportunity investigate, experiment, discover and solve problems within a situation of play.</p>

The report from Gambia (2014) states that all schools should have such spaces and facilities so that students can practise sports or other free-time activities. Not only does the report from Palau (2017) indicate the percentage of children who participate in organised activities, it also reflects on the importance of these spaces of play by recognising that playgrounds were not traditionally recognised since children were assigned household tasks and chores. The school system has introduced the promotion of organised activities and has turned playgrounds into spaces where children interact, meet other children and learn from each other.</p>

The report from Bangladesh (2014) openly recognises that many poor and disadvantaged children continue to be deprived of opportunities for leisure, recreation, games and cultural activities.</p>

Its goal is to make the public primary and secondary school located in urban regions afflicted by violence and social vulnerability available to the entire community at weekends. This same initiative is being carried out in Japan (2017), but play may not fit into these spaces since, as gleaned from its report, activities like learning, interacting with nature and cultural, artistic, sport and other kinds of activities are held in the open Japanese playgrounds. However, there is no reference to play.</p>

                                 <p id="p-74">Another interesting aspect worth bearing in mind is related to the use and enjoyment of free time. The report from the Netherlands (2014) refers to the lack of free time among youths. The report from the Solomon Islands (2017) reveals that children complain about a lack of free time because they have to spend that time on household chores and homework. Coupled with this lack of time is the problem of how it is used. The report from Mongolia (2016) warns about the fact that the main place where adolescents and youths spend their time is virtual gaming centres.</p>

In 72.91% of the Final Observations, the CRC has not issued an opinion on the child’s right to play. Only in 21.87% of the Final Observations does the CRC refer explicitly and directly to General Observation No. 17, while in the remaining 5.22% of Final Observations the Committee does mention article 31.</p>

                           <p id="p-78">t school, the Committee is profoundly concerned –Iran (2016) and Maldives (2016)– with discrimination against girls because they have a very limited right to participate in free-time and leisure activities, both inside and outside school. In the Final Observations for Honduras (2015), the Committee further fleshes out this standard by indicating that the few spaces available for recreation in this country lack a gender perspective and often exclude girls. In addition to the recommendation to provide recreational spaces both inside and outside schools –Honduras (2015)– the Committee also suggests –Gambia (2015)– that schools offer children sports, leisure and cultural activities.</p>

To do so, the States Parties –as the Committee requests of Bangladesh (2015)– should assign all the human, technical and financial resources needed to initiatives that promote and facilitate children’s play time in public spaces, schools and homes.</p>

                  <h2 class="heading" id="t-9b0a524ba35b">DISCUSSION</h2>
                  <p id="t-5c362bda8f85">For the time being, the entry into force of General Observation No. 17 has not led to a significant change in which the States Parties’ pay greater attention to the child’s right to play. The Committee has slightly increased the number of recommendations, but it still draws the States Parties’ attention to the need to comply with article 31 in a very limited way. </p>
                  <p id="p-58e48c9b1c2f">The international scene tells us that there are some countries with good practices (Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden and United Kingdom), but based on the reports and Final Observations, the majority of the States Parties violate the obligation to fulfil article 31. To make matters worse, there are states that openly recognise that they do not pay attention to this right due to a lack of recognition of this need (Ethiopia, 2013).</p>
                  <p id="p-d3781990552e">The reports have shown the little prominence and consideration given to play in the family. In school, the establishment and regulation of school recreational time and having better free-time facilities are achievements. However, oftentimes schools lack inclusive playgrounds. Furthermore, little importance is attached to independent play in educational systems and plans. The social sphere is where most initiatives have taken place. The spectrum of situations is broad, from States Parties that are sensitive to the importance of this right to others that do not pay it sufficient attention. It is very common for leisure policies not to take account of the states’ child policies, and thus legislative and financial measures are lacking.</p>
                  <p id="p-083cec85d5b2">The reports primarily cite play areas. However, there are few references to playtime, and even less mention is made of play materials and playmates. Play should be viewed holistically because having the right spaces may foster it, but they do not guarantee child play, which requires time, materials and playmates to reinforce free-time activity.</p>
                  <p id="p-d83e20ece5f0">One essential factor that cannot be ignored is that the States Parties provide information without making it fully clear whether they are achievements or statements of intentions. There are virtually no comments on laws and regulations that encourage, finance or regulate the child’s right to play. The reports primarily point out measures and actions, but the plans and projects within which they should be framed in order to foster and develop them are described in a highly ambiguous fashion, and if the processes are not clearly shown, the results achieved cannot be reported in a clear, transparent fashion.</p>
                  <p id="p-064f61dd9113">Proof of this is, for example, the fact that in the guidelines on drafting the reports, the States Parties are asked to report on the number/percentage of children in extracurricular activities; on the number of public playgrounds in the communities and whether they are in rural or urban settings; and on the number/percentage of children who participate in organised leisure, sports, cultural and artistic activities, and whether they are in rural or urban settings. However, despite the obligation to do this, the States Parties provide no statistical information.</p>
                  <p id="p-b777ba774eaf">Furthermore, two of them refer to extracurricular and organised activities, which is far from article 31’s intention to promote autonomous play unsupervised by adults. Despite this observation, the guidelines do have indicators. However, it may be questionable whether three indicators are enough, because “to improve something you have to first measure it” (Adamson,<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="#R111493522305288"

                  <p id="p-84994d516ccd">One of the first experiments with indicators is the one promoted by the Annie E. Casey Foundation (1990) with the publication of an annual report entitled <i id="e-83cca9e209cc">Kids Count Data Book</i> on child welfare in the United States. A significant leap in terms of the need to evaluate using indicators was taken when the CRC (2003), in the General Measures to Implement the Convention, proclaimed the urgency of gathering sufficient, reliable data on children which encompasses all of childhood until the age of 18, as well as including the monitoring mechanisms which make it possible to prove the enforcement of the rights within the evaluation system itself. A quick response to the CRC’s call was presented in the study by  (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="#R111493522305287"

In parallel, several years ago the International Society for Childhood Indicators (ISCI) launched a working group, in conjunction with UNICEF among its promoters, with the purpose of encouraging the collection of international data among children aged 8, 10 and 12. The specific objective of that project, called “The International Survey of Children’s Well-Being” (ISCWeB), is to gather reliable, representative data on the lives of children and their everyday activities, their use of time and particularly their perception of their own wellbeing. Within Europe, (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="#R111493522305307"

Furthermore, the aforementioned International Society for Child Indicators (ISCI) has an international journal entitled <i id="emphasis-3">Child Indicators Research </i> (CIR). Therefore, we can claim that “The Child Indicators Movement” is gradually gaining momentum.</p>
                  <p id="p-75a1251f2829">However, the indicators referring to free-time activity are absent or only barely present in scholarly or academic studies  (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="#R111493522305303"

This absence confirms not only the need to promote the recognition of children’s universal right to play but also the urgency of having an effective tool –such as the formulation of a system of indicators– to evaluate it.</p>

                  <p id="t-e189b3e7dc1a">Policies in favour of children in which play is ignored cannot be developed. It is indeed possible to cite other priorities or urgencies, but it still makes no sense because the ones who most need to have play as a major ally to contribute to their development are the most disadvantaged children, the most vulnerable ones, the ones who live in poverty, who grow without the care of their parents, who suffer from various kinds of exploitation, violence, abuse or mistreatment.</p>
                  <p id="p-34f6cf862b0c">The lack of play in under-developed countries where children are largely faceless is mentioned repeatedly. However, albeit in a very different way, the welfare society often skews compliance with the right to play based on the lack of time for play by prioritising extracurricular activities, pressure from parents or the lack of places to play, just to cite a few of the most common problems. Identifying the difficulties in exercising this right in advanced societies is also a challenge.</p>
                  <p id="p-e53c327dba63">By managing to formulate a system of indicators to evaluate recognition of the child’s right to play  (<a class="xref xref-bibr" href="#R111493522305310"

                        data-jats-ref-type="bibr">Payà &amp; Bantulà, 2019</a>), it will be possible to have benchmarks or points of reference to monitor compliance with this right, enable it to be evaluated and suggest both the inclusion of indicators of child play in indices and indicators of childhood and ensure that play is part of the objectives, goals and strategies of the action plans in favour of children.</p>
